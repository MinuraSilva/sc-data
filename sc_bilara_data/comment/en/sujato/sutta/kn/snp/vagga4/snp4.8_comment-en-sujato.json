  "snp4.8:1.3": "Norman has “good” for <i lang='pi' translate='no'>subha</i>, Bodhi “excellent”, but the Niddesa shows that the sense is “illuminating, bringing wisdom”. Compare the same phrase at [snp4.13:16.3](), where the context shows we are speaking of those whose doctrine is derived from meditative experience. Perhaps here (as in the Pārāyanavagga) we are dealing with ascetics who rely on the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>subhavimutti</i>, the “beautiful release” (of jhānas).",
  "snp4.8:1.4": "Here, as at [snp4.12:15.3](), <i lang='pi' translate='no'>puthu</i> emphasizes how they all have their own distinct view.",
  "snp4.8:2.2": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Dahanti</i> is to “regard” or “see”, per Niddesa and Commentary; Bodhi’s “accuse” seems hard to justify.",
  "snp4.8:11.3": "Here, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>yuga</i> is connected in the Niddesa with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>yugaggāha</i> (“taking the reins”), which in turn is connected in [vb17:75.2]() with “causing disputes”. It seems to be an idiom for “issuing a challenge”. In any case, it has a stronger sense than just “met, encountered”.",
  "snp4.8:11.4": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Sakkhasi</i> is 2nd future, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sampayātave</i> is infinitive. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Sampāyati</i> is a fairly common word, “answer a question”, usually in a negative sense, to be “stumped” by a question. Oddly, most translators (Bodhi, Norman, Ñāṇadīpa, Thanissaro) don’t catch this sense."
