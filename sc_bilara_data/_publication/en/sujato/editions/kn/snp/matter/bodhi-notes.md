II,6 Righteous Conduct (Dhammacariya Sutta), verses 274–83


II,7 The Tradition of the Brahmins (Brāhmaṇadhammika Sutta),
verses 284–315
As the longest discourse in the Cūḷavagga, this sutta would seem to fit
better in the Mahāvagga (chapter III), but it was probably included here
because of the affinity between its title and that of the Dhammacariya Sutta.
Another reason may be the parallelism between their themes. Just as the
Dhammacariya Sutta decries the corruption besetting the monastic order,
the Brāhmaṇadhammika Sutta deplores the deterioration that had taken
place among the brahmins. Its theme, however, is not the inequity of the
caste system but the heinous cruelty of animal sacrifice, particularly of
cattle. The sutta views this practice as a grave violation of the moral order
that ushers in a multitude of physical and social ills.
The thirty-two verses of the sutta can be divided into four groups, which
might be called “before the fall, the initial fall, the deeper fall, and after the
fall.” The period “before the fall” (284–98) describes an ideal period in the
distant past when the brahmins were models of spiritual glory. They were
self-controlled, austere, pious, and simple in their way of life, revered by
the population. Some observed life-long celibacy (293), others emulated
their practice (294), but even the least diligent among them lived “within
the boundary,” performing sacrificial services that did not involve animal
slaughter (297). As a result, “this population happily flourished” (298).
With 299–305, the initial fall takes place. Coveting wealth, cattle, and
women, the brahmins composed hymns enjoining sacrifice, went to the
kings, and persuaded them to hold sacrifices, which the brahmins
performed in return for lavish rewards. Still not content, “their craving
increased still more,” and they descended into the deeper fall (306–10).
They now composed hymns calling for the sacrifice of cattle and recited
these to the kings, who initiated the slaughter of cattle. At this point the
brahmins had completely abandoned their original heritage. The remaining
verses (311–15) describe the aftermath of the deeper fall. Diseases afflicting
humankind increase, marital relations become disharmonious, socialconflict and disorder spreads, and the population falls into the grip of
sensual craving.
Somewhat strangely, disregard for the doctrine of birth (jātivādaṃ
niraṃkatvā) is included among the misfortunes that result from the
slaughter of cattle. At 596, “the doctrine of birth” is identified with the view
that “one is a brahmin by birth” (jātiyā brāhmaṇo hoti), a doctrine clearly
rejected by the Buddha. Yet here disregard for this doctrine is lamented as a
sign of deterioration, presumably because it leads to intermarriage among
people born into different castes. There seems to be here an incongruity
between this line of the text and the view expressed elsewhere that caste
distinctions are purely conventional.

II,8 The Boat (Nāvā Sutta), verses 316–23
This sutta is named after the simile in 321, but if it is the word dhamma that
draws together the preceding two suttas, it might also be the alternative title
of this discourse, Dhamma Sutta, that explains its position in immediate
succession to them. The sutta deals with the proper relationship between the
teacher of the Dhamma and the student. The student, it says, should
venerate the teacher “as the deities venerate Indra.” When the student
shows respect, humility, and eagerness to learn, the teacher should
generously share the Dhamma. Having learned the teaching, the pupil
should then practice as instructed.
The discourse issues stern warnings to both prospective students and
aspiring teachers. The student must use discretion in selecting a teacher. If
one resorts to a wrong teacher, “a petty fool who has not reached the goal,”
one will end in failure. The teacher too must be properly qualified. An
unqualified teacher would be like a person who has stepped into a mighty
river and, swept off by the torrent, is unable to cross himself, much less to
help others across. But just as one who has entered a boat can carry others
across, so one accomplished in the Dhamma, “learned and of unwavering
character,” can guide students who are attentive and willing to learn.II,9 What Good Behavior? (Kiṃsīla Sutta), verses 324–30
According to the commentary, the questions posed in the opening verse of
this sutta were asked by Sāriputta on behalf of a friend from lay life, a
wealthy young brahmin who had gone forth but could not make progress.
Sāriputta brought him to the Buddha and asked the questions in the hope the
Buddha would provide suitable instructions. The discourse deals with the
proper conduct a monastic pupil should adopt toward teachers and it thus
serves as a short guide to monastic etiquette.
II,10 Arouse Yourselves! (Uṭṭhāna Sutta), verses 331–34
This short sutta of four stanzas sounds a stirring call for diligent effort. The
commentary explains that the verses were spoken in connection with an
incident reported at SN 51:14. At the time a number of young bhikkhus
living on the ground floor of Migāramātā’s mansion were dwelling
heedlessly. The Buddha asked Mahāmoggallāna to stir up a sense of
urgency in them, which he did by using his psychic powers to cause the
mansion to “shake, quake, and tremble” by touching it with his toe. When
the monks emerged, shocked and frightened, the Buddha spoke the verses
to urge them to strive more diligently in their practice.
II,11 Rāhula (Rāhula Sutta), verses 335–42
This sutta is addressed by the Buddha to his son Rāhula, who became a
novice during the Buddha’s first return visit to Kapilavatthu in the first year
after his enlightenment. The Pāli Canon contains three other discourses
addressed to Rāhula, but this is the only one entirely in verse. A sentence at
the end of the sutta, evidently added by the compilers, states: “In such a
way the Blessed One often exhorted the Venerable Rāhula with these
verses.” This signifies that the verses were not recited only on a single
occasion but were taught repeatedly during the period of Rāhula’s training.
The sutta begins with two introductory verses (335–36). According to
the commentary, the first was addressed by the Buddha to Rāhula and the
second is Rāhula’s reply. The expression “torchbearer of humankind”
(ukkādhāro manussānaṃ) in the first verse raises suspicion that the verse
was not actually spoken by the Buddha but by someone else. While thecommentary says that the Buddha used this expression with reference to
Sāriputta, the expression itself seems to better fit the Buddha, who
elsewhere is compared to a man who brings a lamp into a dark room so
people can see forms (see p. 1456, note 1195).
The six verses of instruction cover, with remarkable concision and
elegance, the full range of monastic training, from the first steps to the final
goal. Stanza 337 reminds Rāhula of the meaning of his act of renunciation,
undertaken out of faith and for the purpose of making an end to suffering.
Stanza 338 stresses the importance of good friendship, seclusion, and
moderation in eating; 339–40ab covers other aspects of moral discipline;
340cd–341 directs Rāhula to meditate on the unattractive nature of the
body, which heightens the sense of disenchantment and brings one-pointed
concentration. Stanza 342a refers to the “markless state” (animitta), the
concentration of insight knowledge that culminates in the breakthrough to
the world-transcending path; 342b speaks of the latent tendency to conceit,
a subtle defilement that persists even in a non-returner; and 342cd states
that with the elimination of conceit one will “live at peace,” as an arahant
who has reached the end of suffering.
II,12 Vaṅgīsa (Vaṅgīsa Sutta), verses 343–58
Vaṅgīsa was declared by the Buddha the bhikkhu foremost in inspirational
ingenuity (paṭibhāna). His field of expertise was the composition of poetry.
In the Vaṅgīsasaṃyutta (SN chap. 8) he displays his skill in creating
improvised verse. He also has seventy-one verses in the Theragāthā, the
largest number in that collection. These include the verses of this sutta.
The prose introduction to this sutta explains how after his preceptor,
Nigrodhakappa, died, Vaṅgīsa was plagued by doubt whether he had
attained final nibbāna. To settle his doubt, he went to the Buddha, and as a
poet, pleaded in verse for an answer. Apparently he spoke in the midst of
the Sangha, for in the verses he refers to others present who are eager to
hear. His verses display a high degree of poetic refinement, which sets them
off from the unembellished style of most early Buddhist poetry. Vaṅgīsa
addresses the Buddha with majestic epithets. He calls him the universal eye,
the one of broad wisdom, the supreme eye for humans, one of perfect
wisdom, and so forth. He also makes use of metaphors and similes: theBuddha is like Sakka among the devas (346d), like a wind dispelling clouds
(348b); his voice is like the honking of a goose (350b); he himself is like a
man afflicted by heat and the Buddha’s words are like a downpour of rain
(353cd). Finally, after an elaborate appeal for clarification, the Buddha
tersely declares that Nigrodhakappa had indeed “crossed over birth and
death entirely” (355). This was the answer that Vaṅgīsa had longed to hear,
and he welcomes it with joy (356–58).

II,13 Proper Wandering (Sammāparibbājanīya Sutta), verses 359–
75
According to the commentary, this sutta was spoken at the Great Gathering
(mahāsamaya) in response to questions posed by a mind-created buddha.
The Great Gathering occurred when five hundred of the Buddha’s relatives
who had gone forth as monks attained arahantship. Half were paternal
relatives, half maternal relatives. They came in immediate sequence on a
full-moon night to report their attainment. As the Buddha sat in their midst,
surrounded by the five hundred newly enlightened arahants, countless
deities from ten thousand world systems came to visit the assembly, hoping
to hear a discourse.
The Buddha realized that the mode of teaching that would be most
beneficial to the deities would be one given in response to questions.
However, he also saw that no one present was able to ask the right
questions. He therefore used his psychic power to mentally create a
duplicate of himself. The duplicate asked the questions and he himself
responded.
According to the commentary, on this occasion the Buddha gave six
discourses in the mode of question and response; each was intended for
deities of a different temperament. Five are included in the Aṭṭhakavagga
(chap. IV). The Discourse on Proper Wandering, intended for those of
lustful temperament, was somehow placed in the Cūḷavagga.
The theme of the discourse is revealed in the question posed in the
opening verse: “How should a bhikkhu who has renounced the household
life properly wander in the world?” The Buddha’s answer, the commentarysays, explains the arahant’s practice up to its culmination in arahantship.
The verses seem to extend over two stages of development, path and
realization. The path stage is the practice of a disciple training for the final
goal. This stage is suggested by the use of optative verbs, such as “should
remove lust” (rāgaṃ vinayetha) in 361a, “should discard anger and
meanness” (kodhaṃ kadariyaṃ jaheyya) in 362b, and “should not be
elated” (na uṇṇameyya) in 366a. The stage of training is also indicated by
the
expression
“aspiring
for
the
state
of
nibbāna”
(nibbānapadābhipatthayāno) in 365c. The stage of realization is reached by
the arahant, described by such expressions as “utterly released from things
that fetter,” “one who has no latent tendencies,” “whose influxes have been
destroyed,” and “a purified conqueror who has removed the coverings.”
Strikingly, the word “muni” does not occur in the exposition but only in the
opening address to the Buddha.
II,14 Dhammika (Dhammika Sutta), verses 376–404
The title of this discourse again suggests that several suttas with dhamma or
dhammika in their titles were drawn together into a single chapter. With
twenty-nine verses, this is the second longest sutta in the chapter. The sutta
is named after the lay follower Dhammika, who is highly extolled by Pj II
as a non-returner of good behavior, learned in the Tipiṭaka (a clear
anachronism), and possessing psychic powers. He is the head of a retinue of
five hundred lay followers, which suggests he is a man of influence.
However, he is not referred to elsewhere in the Nikāyas.
In his opening verse (376) he asks the Buddha about the behavior of two
kinds of disciples, the renunciant and the lay follower. This is followed by a
series of effusive stanzas that eulogize the Buddha, with allusions to
incidents recorded elsewhere: the visits of the nāga king Erāvaṇa and the
deity Vessavaṇa Kuvera, and the Buddha’s triumphs in debate over other
ascetics and brahmins. The stanzas thus display literary artifice,
presupposing that the listener is acquainted with the traditional lore about
the Buddha.
The Buddha’s reply can be divided into two parts. The first deals with
the proper conduct of a bhikkhu (385–92) and the second with the
householder’s duty (393–404). The first verse in the reply is addressed notto Dhammika the inquirer but to the bhikkhus, suggesting a disjunction in
the composition of the poem. The instructions given for a bhikkhu cover
proper deportment, right behavior on the alms round, restraint and
circumspection in speech, and proper use of the material requisites. The
emphasis here is strikingly different from that of the Muni Sutta or the
Sammāparibbājaniya Sutta, where the ascetic and contemplative elements
are more prominent. Here the advice seems more appropriate for a monk in
the initial stages of training.
The section on the householder’s duty begins with the recognition that
the layperson cannot be expected to fully emulate the practice of a
renunciant. The first six stanzas of advice (394–99) expound on the five
precepts. The stanza on the third precept recommends complete sexual
abstinence as the ideal and sex within marriage as second best. Whereas the
first four precepts are accorded only one stanza, abstinence from intoxicants
receives two. Stanzas 400–402 deal with observance of the uposatha, 403
with the layperson’s duty to feed the Sangha, and 404 with other
householder duties such as support for parents and right livelihood. The
discourse reflects a period when a sizeable lay community had constellated
around the Buddha and it had become necessary for the Buddha to explain
the specific responsibilities of monastics and laypeople both in their own
domains and in their mutual relations.
III THE GREAT CHAPTER (MAHĀVAGGA)
III,1 The Going Forth (Pabbajjā Sutta), verses 405–24
The Pabbajjā Sutta and its sequel, the Padhāna Sutta, along with the
introductory verses of the Nālaka Sutta, are the earliest attempts to narrate
in verse major events in the Buddha’s life. Since each revolves around a
particular incident, it would be an exaggeration to say that they constitute a
primitive biography of the Buddha, but they certainly provided material for
the construction of such a biography.
The narrative portion of the Pabbajjā Sutta, according to the
commentary, was spoken by Ānanda, but the centerpiece of the sutta is the
dialogue between the future Buddha and King Bimbisāra at the PāṇḍavaHill outside Rājagaha. According to the commentary, the Buddha went to
Rājagaha soon after renouncing the household life. The Jātaka Commentary
(I 65,29–30) says that after he arrived at Anupiya, he first spent a week
enjoying the bliss of renunciation and then left for Rājagaha, completing the
200-mile trip in one day. From this it follows that the encounter with
Bimbisāra took place before the Buddha became a pupil of Āḷāra Kālāma,
as told in MN 26 (at MN I 164–65).
The style of the Pabbajjā Sutta is simple and unadorned, free of
embellishments and extraneous accretions. The Buddha is referred to as
“Buddha” even though the sutta is set prior to his enlightenment. He is not
called a bodhisatta. Several times the Buddha is referred to as “the bhikkhu”
(411d, 412c, 416a) and once as a muni (414b). When asked about his
origins, he does not identify himself as the son of a king, as the later legend
has it, but acknowledges that the Sakyan realm was a protectorate of
Kosala.
There is a parallel to the Pabbajjā Sutta in the Sanskrit Mahāvastu and
another parallel in Chinese in the Four-Part Vinaya ( 四 分 律 ) of the
Dharmaguptaka school (T XXII no. 1428). This indicates that the story of a
meeting between the future Buddha and Bimbisāra was shared by different
schools of Early Buddhism. The story is not recorded elsewhere in the
Nikāyas, but it is told in the Jātaka Commentary (I 66), which refers to the
Pabbajjā Sutta. The two men met after the Buddha began his teaching
mission (at Vin I 37). On that occasion the Buddha taught the Dhamma to
Bimbisāra and his retinue, who all attained stream-entry.

III,2 Striving (Padhāna Sutta), verses 425–49
Although the Pabbajjā Sutta ends with the Buddha saying, “I will go for the
purpose of striving,” the events of the Padhāna Sutta, on the theme of
striving, could not have occurred in immediate sequence. The sutta
describes the Buddha’s exertion during his period of extreme ascetic
practice. If we accept the testimony of the Nikāyas, particularly MN 36 (at I
240), before the Buddha took up self-mortification he mastered the formlessmeditative attainments under Āḷāra Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmaputta. It was
only after he left them that he pursued the practice of self-mortification.
This means that the events narrated in the two suttas of Sn are separated by
a temporal gap.
The Padhāna Sutta also differs from its predecessor in its flavor.
Whereas the Pabbajjā Sutta is plain and realistic, the Padhāna Sutta
introduces myth and personification in a short epic of the spiritual hero
struggling against the forces of metaphysical evil, here represented by
Māra. At the time the story occurs, the Buddha has not yet taken his seat
beneath the bodhi tree, determined to reach perfect enlightenment that very
day. He is still engaged in his ascetic practices, intent on pursuing them to
their limits. Thus Māra’s dialogue with the Buddha precedes the assault he
will launch when the Buddha discovers the middle way, regains his physical
vigor, and makes the great determination.
The sutta is a powerful drama in which Māra adopts the guise of
compassionate concern in his efforts to persuade the Buddha to give up his
exertion and instead accumulate merits as a householder. The Buddha
resolutely rejects this proposal and spurns the ten “armies of Māra.” These
are treated metaphorically, but in the later Māra legend, the armies become
actual demonic troops goaded by Māra into a relentless effort to drive the
future Buddha away from his seat beneath the bodhi tree. Included among
the ten armies are sensuality, discontent, and craving, which become
personified as the three daughters of Māra who try unsuccessfully to seduce
the Buddha (see SN 4:25, I 124–26).
A temporal gap in the Buddha’s life separates the last four stanzas of the
poem, 446–49, from the previous ones. These stanzas seem to have been
appended to the original sutta, which would have achieved closure if it had
ended at 445. Since Māra says here that he has followed the Buddha for
seven years, this would put them a year after the enlightenment. Stanza 446
may have found its way into this poem from the floating mass of oral verses
describing different events in the Buddha’s life. Stanzas 447–48 are found
elsewhere (at SN I 124), as is 449, which seems out of context at SN I 122.
These verses may have been “borrowed” from their original sources and
inserted here to demonstrate that in his battle with Māra the Buddha
ultimately prevailed.Parallels from other traditions: Sanskrit: Mvu II 238–40; Lalitavistara

III,3 Well-Spoken (Subhāsita Sutta), verses 450–54
This short sutta in mixed prose and verse again gives Vaṅgīsa the
opportunity to display his poetic skill, this time on well-spoken speech. In
the prose passage the Buddha enumerates four constituents of well-spoken
speech, which oddly include “well-spoken speech” as one factor among
them. After he restates the same points in verse, Vaṅgīsa asks permission to
speak, and when permission is granted, he recites verses that explain his
understanding of well-spoken speech as words that cause no harm to
oneself or others. He next goes a step further and declares truth to be the
dhammo sanantano — the ancient principle on which both the good and the
Dhamma are grounded. Since it leads to nibbāna, the supreme good,
Vaṅgīsa extols the Buddha’s word as “the supreme speech.”

III,4 Sundarikabhāradvāja (Sundarikabhāradvāja Sutta), verses
455–86
This discourse — also known as the Pūraḷāsa Sutta, “The Sacrificial Cake”
— has a part-parallel in the Saṃyutta Nikāya (SN 7:9, I 167–70). In both
the interlocutor is the brahmin Sundarikabhāradvāja. The two have the same
prose introduction and share several verses (462–63, 480–81), but otherwise
they go off in very different directions. This demonstrates how the
compilers of the texts might have selected different sets of verses
circulating among the communities of reciters and then provided them with
the same prose framework, even though it is impossible that two different
discourses could have been given on the same occasion and under the same
circumstances. In this sutta the verse section seems confused in places, and
it is even unclear whether certain lines (between 456 and 461) should be
understood as prose interjections or as unmetrical verse. The commentarytries to unravel the confusion but it seems the text itself has been partly
corrupted.
The sutta, like several we have so far encountered, pits the Buddha
against a brahmin, this time over the question of who is worthy to receive
offerings. The brahmin, spotting a robed figure sitting near the site of his
Vedic ritual, is about to offer him the sacrificial cake, but when he discovers
that the intended recipient is not a brahmin but an ascetic, he pulls back,
about to withdraw the offering. The Buddha, however, challenges the
brahmin’s assumption. He first completely dissociates himself from caste
affiliations, denying (in 455) even that he is a prince; instead he defines
himself as a true “man of nought”: “I am not a brahmin nor am I a prince; I
am not a vessa or anything else.” He denies that the merit of an offering is
determined by the recipient’s birth, insisting that the merit depends upon the
recipient’s moral and spiritual qualities. Someone from a low family may be
“a steadfast muni” and thus may be the one most worthy of the offering
(462).
In stanzas 463–66 the Buddha describes in general terms those who
deserve to receive an oblation. They are those who have renounced sensual
pleasures, are devoid of lust, wander in the world without attachments, and
have abandoned taking things as “mine.” Each verse ends in the refrain: “a
brahmin who would sacrifice intent on merit should make a timely oblation
to him.” But with 467 he changes pitch and launches into a hymn of self-
praise extending over eleven verses, each ending in the refrain: “the
Tathāgata is worthy of the sacrificial cake.” Almost all the terms used in
this hymn would be applicable to any arahant and thus are still indicative of
Buddhism in its early phase, before sharp distinctions were drawn that
elevated the Buddha to heights above his arahant disciples.
Through the force of the Buddha’s argument the brahmin is won over
and states his wish to make his offering to the Buddha. The Buddha,
however, refuses the offering. We here meet the verses encountered earlier
(81–82), where the Buddha rejected an offering on the ground that “food
over which verses have been recited is not to be eaten by me.” It is in this
context rather than the earlier one that the rejection makes sense, for the
food was previously the object of the brahmanic ritual, consecrated by the
recitation of brahmanic verses.The prose passage that concludes the sutta ends in the familiar way. The
brahmin abandons his reservations, goes for refuge, asks to go forth under
the Buddha, and finally attains arahantship.
Pāli parallel: SN 7:9 (part only)
III,5 Māgha (Māgha Sutta), verses 487–509
The theme of this sutta is similar to the preceding one, but the questioner, a
brahmin youth named Māgha, does not approach the Buddha as an
antagonist but as a reverential inquirer. His question, as posed in the
opening stanza, is: “Who are worthy recipients of gifts for householders in
quest of merit?” The question is raised against the backdrop of the ancient
Indian belief that gifts of food and other requisites create spiritual merit,
wholesome kamma conducive to good fortune in future lives, with the
volume of merit dependent on the virtues of the recipients.
The Buddha replies by describing those who are true fields of merit. He
does not specifically refer to himself and his own disciples but describes the
qualities of the ideal recipients in broad terms characteristic of all arahants.
Several of the verses correspond to those of the preceding sutta and the tone
throughout is identical. When Māgha asks about the best way to perform
the sacrifice, the Buddha explains the threefold excellence, which the
commentary explains as giving with a placid mind before, during, and after
the presentation of the gift. In its original context, however, what was
intended may have been the excellence of the giver, the recipients, and the
gifts. It is noteworthy that Māgha asks only about the way to rebirth in the
brahma world, and the Buddha responds at the level of the question,
without attempting to reveal the path of insight that leads to liberation. This
illustrates the Buddha’s pedagogical technique of assessing the capacities of
the listeners and framing the teaching in a way that corresponds to their
aptitude and inclinations.
III,6 Sabhiya (Sabhiya Sutta), verses 510–47
The Sabhiya Sutta begins with a long prose narrative about a wanderer
named Sabhiya who is told by a guardian deity that he should live the
spiritual life under an ascetic or brahmin who can answer certain questionsfor him. He approaches the six heterodox teachers, the Buddha’s rivals in
the Magadha region, but not only do they fail to reply to his question, even
worse “they displayed irritation, hatred, and displeasure, and they even
questioned the wanderer Sabhiya himself.” This portion of the sutta is
remarkably similar to the opening narrative of the Sāmaññaphala Sutta,
where King Ajātasattu tells of how he asked the six teachers about the fruits
of the ascetic life without receiving a satisfactory reply (DN I 52–59).
Finally, Sabhiya considers visiting the ascetic Gotama to ask these
questions. At first he hesitates, because Gotama is much younger than the
six teachers, but he then considers: “An ascetic should not be belittled or
disparaged just because he is young. For even if an ascetic is young, he
might be powerful and mighty.” We can detect here echoes of the Buddha’s
reply to King Pasenadi on their first meeting (SN I 69,1–7). After a long
journey, Sabhiya reaches Rājagaha, meets the Buddha, and relates the
purpose of his visit.
Speaking now in verse, Sabhiya requests permission to ask his questions
and the Buddha invites him to speak up, assuring him: “I’ll answer you
according to the Dhamma.” The dialogue that ensues is entirely in verse,
with prose passages inserted only to demarcate the sections. Sabhiya’s
questions all concern the meaning of various terms that must have been
discussed by the ascetics of northern India. The terms describe the ideal
spiritual figure of the contemplative quest, the type of person who embodies
the supreme goal. The terms about which Sabhiya seeks clarification from
the Buddha fall into five groups, which are divided merely as a matter of
convenience and not by any difference in their subject matter: (1) bhikkhu,
gentle, tamed, enlightened (buddha); (2) brahmin, ascetic, cleansed, nāga;
(3) field-knower, skilled, pundit (paṇḍita), muni; (4) Veda-master,
cognizant, heroic, thoroughbred; (5) scholar, noble, one of good conduct,
wanderer. The word saṃnyāsin, the preferred term of later Indian
monasticism, is not among them, and thus it is likely the word originated
later or at least became widespread subsequent to the age of Early
Buddhism. The same is true of paramahaṃsa, “supreme goose,” the word
used in Hindu contemplative circles to designate the accomplished sage.
The answers to the questions involve subtle word plays and edifying
etymologies that are extremely hard to translate into English in ways thatcorrespond to the term being examined. The explanations themselves, in
fact, sometimes preserve their relevance only in the Middle Indo-Aryan
dialects and become tenuous when the texts are transposed into Sanskrit, or
even in partly Sanskritized Pāli. Thus, as Norman has pointed out (GD 258;
see too Norman 2006a, 134), the edifying derivation of brāhmaṇa from
bāhetvā sabbapāpani, “one who has expelled all evil,” would have been
discernible only in a dialect in which the word was pronounced bāhaṇa.
With the partial Sanskritization of the Pāli texts, brāhmaṇa was adopted for
bāhaṇa and the pun became opaque. But the playful derivation of samaṇa,
ascetic (literally “striver”), from samitāvi, “peaceful one,” remained intact
in Pāli but lost its cogency in Sanskrit, where śramaṇa could not be easily
connected to śamitāvi. In some places explanatory lines seem to have
migrated from the place where they properly belong, creating gaps in the
explanation. There is a Sanskrit parallel to the Sabhiya verses in the
Mahāvastu and another parallel in the Chinese translation of the
*Abhiniṣkramaṇa Sūtra. As is inevitable in a literature originally oral, their
explanations differ in places from the Pāli.
After the Buddha has answered all his question, Sabhiya extols him in
verses of lyrical beauty. He then pays homage to the Buddha, and — the
prose conclusion reports — he goes for refuge, receives ordination, and
attains arahantship.

III,7 Sela (Sela Sutta), verses 548–73
The Sela Sutta is another conversion story, this time centered on the erudite
brahmin Sela. The sutta has an exact parallel in Majjhima Nikāya 92. The
sutta opens with the encounter between the Buddha and another teacher
named Keṇiya, whose status is unclear. The text describes him as a jaṭila, a
type of ascetic that wore matted locks. Elsewhere the jaṭilas are depicted as
celibate and as guardians of the sacred fire (perhaps votaries of the god
Agni), but Keṇiya is shown as living partly like a householder, with a large
hermitage where he is surrounded by family and relatives. The Buddha
twice rejects his offer to provide a meal, but when asked a third time he
silently consents.This sets the dramatic background to the discourse. When Keṇiya’s
teacher, the learned brahmin Sela, arrives along with his three hundred
students, Keṇiya informs Sela that he has invited the Buddha for the next
day’s meal. The very word “buddha” causes a wave of astonishment and
exhilaration in Sela, for, he says, “even this sound ‘buddha’ is rarely
encountered in the world.” Sela is described as a master of the Three Vedas
and their auxiliary texts, which apparently include traditions about buddhas
and their secular counterpart, the wheel-turning monarch — at least
according to the sutta.
Sela then visits the Buddha to determine whether Keṇiya’s report is
true. He examines the Buddha’s body for the thirty-two marks of a great
man, which he had learned about through his study of brahmanic lore.
When he ascertains that the Buddha possesses all thirty-two marks —
including one mark that could only be perceived with the help of the
Buddha’s psychic power — he extols the Buddha in verse and questions
him about his attainment. In verse 558 the Buddha gives the most concise
definition of a buddha found in the Nikāyas: one who has known what
should be known, developed what should be developed, and abandoned
what should be abandoned. He asks Sela to suspend his doubts, assuring
him that his teaching is “well proclaimed, directly visible, immediate.”
Having overcome their doubts, Sela and his students go forth, withdraw
into seclusion, and attain arahantship. On the eighth day after their
ordination, they return to the Buddha and announce their attainment,
praising the Buddha in verse. Two of the stanzas are exactly the same as
those in Sabhiya’s eulogy (571–72 = 545–46). Like Sabhiya, in the final
stanza Sela asks the Buddha to extend his feet so that he and his pupils can
worship them.

III,8 The Dart (Salla Sutta), verses 574–93
This sutta seems out of place in this collection, for it is a simple didactic
poem lodged in the midst of long discourses composed in mixed prose and
verse and apparently designed to demonstrate the Buddha’s success in
converting his contemporaries among the ascetics and brahmins of theIndian spiritual scene. The poem is a homily on death whose themes have
been the stuff of Buddhist sermons down the centuries. The “dart” in the
title is grief over the death of loved ones. The poem reminds us that the
arrival of death is unpredictable; there is no means to avoid death; none of
our loved ones can protect us when death calls on us, and we are helpless to
protect them; we are all like pots doomed to break or like cows heading for
slaughter. The wise recognize this and do not grieve, for they understand
that to grow old and die is the way of the world. When facing loss, sorrow
and lamentation are useless, for they cannot bring the dead back to life,
while grieving only brings harm to oneself. Thus the wise extract the dart of
grief, attain peace of mind, and dwell free of sorrow.
III,9 Vāseṭṭha (Vāseṭṭha Sutta), verses 594–656
This long discourse returns to the topic of the caste system with specific
reference to the question: “How is one a brahmin?” Two brahmin students
take opposing views on the topic. Bhāradvāja espouses the orthodox
brahmanic view that one is a brahmin by birth. Vāseṭṭha represents the
opposing view, which corresponds to that of the Buddha, that one is a
brahmin by reason of one’s good behavior. Unable to settle their
differences, they decide to seek illumination from the Buddha. A similar
background story lies behind Dīgha Nikāya 13, the Tevijja Sutta, where the
same two young brahmins differ about the way to the brahma world and ask
the Buddha to adjudicate in their dispute.
Resorting to verse, the Buddha offers a sustained argument in which he
addresses not only the meaning of the word “brahmin” but the entire system
of human biology and divisive social institutions. He demonstrates first that
while generic divisions separate other types of living beings, human beings
are all biologically alike: “there are no distinctive marks produced by their
particular birth” (607). He then argues that social distinctions are entirely a
matter of convention: “Classification among human beings is spoken of by
designation” (611). This means that human beings are designated as being
this or that because of their activities (612–19). Finally he comes to the
marks of a brahmin, where he employs the technique that I have called
terminological redefinition to propose a reconceptualization of the nature of
a brahmin. A true brahmin, for the Buddha, is not one who can claim aparticular genealogy and maternal origin but one who embodies holiness in
human form. In the long series of verses 620–47 — found also in the
Dhammapada (chap. 26) and which may have been imported into the
discourse from another source — he describes the brahmin as the arahant.
At 648 he returns to the idea that “name and clan” are mere designation
originating by convention and at 650 confirms the position of Vāseṭṭha in
his debate with his friend: “One is not a brahmin by birth, nor by birth a
non-brahmin. By action one becomes a brahmin, by action a non-brahmin.”
At 655 he describes the kind of action by which one becomes a brahmin.
The same verse is recited by the Buddha at Th 631, affirming that Suṇīta, a
former outcast, had attained arahantship and thus become a brahmin in the
supreme sense.
Pleased with the Buddha’s discourse, the two brahmin students go for
refuge and declare themselves lay followers, as they also do at the end of
the Tevijja Sutta. At DN III 80,4–6 it is reported that the two were living
among the bhikkhus and preparing for ordination.

III,10 Kokālika (Kokālika Sutta), verses 657–78
The Kokālika Sutta occurs three times in the Nikāyas, in the Saṃyutta, the
Aṅguttara, and here. This raises the question why it should have been
included in the Suttanipāta. If we look at this anthology as serving, at least
in part, a pedagogical purpose, the sutta may have been included here to
illustrate the grave consequences of maligning the innocent, particularly the
ariyans, the noble ones. The prose portion of the sutta relates the
background. Kokālika was a monk who envied the chief disciples, Sāriputta
and Moggallāna, for the esteem in which the Buddha held them. Out of
spite, he tried to drive a wedge between the Buddha and the chief disciples
by accusing them of having evil motives. Though the Buddha told him to
stop, he continued to malign them and as a result — a “directly visible
fruit” of that kamma — his body broke out in boils, which grew in size and
caused his death. He was reborn in the Paduma hell, one of the hells with
the longest life spans. The rest of the sutta continues in verse.
Where the other two versions end at the equivalent of 660, with a
statement about the duration of life in hell for those who slander the nobleones, the present version continues with a detailed account of the torments
of hell. Pj II ascribes these additional verses to Mahāmoggallāna. This more
elaborate version indicates relative lateness. The descriptions correspond to
those in the Devadūta Sutta (MN 130). It is possible that one influenced the
other, or that both drew upon a common source. The sutta ends with two
verses that Pj II says were not commented on in the Great Commentary
(Mahā-aṭṭhakathā) and thus may have been added by later editors.

III,11 Nālaka (Nālaka Sutta), verses 679–723
The Nālaka Sutta consists of two distinct sections joined by a unifying
thread. The two sections are the introductory verses (vatthugāthā) and the
body of the poem, which is about the practice for achieving the state of a
muni. The introductory verses tell the story of the rishi Asita’s visit to
Kapilavatthu to see the infant Buddha, whose birth into the world he
learned about from the deities. This poem perhaps constitutes the earliest
record in verse of the encounter of Asita with the newborn Buddha. We find
here the sole occurrence in Sn of the word bodhisatta (683a), and it seems
to presuppose the more ornate perspective on the Buddha’s life that we find
in such suttas as MN 123 and texts of a similar genre. The incidents
described in these verses have become mainstays of the familiar Buddha
biography. We learn of Asita’s sojourn among the deities, his hasty
departure for Kapilavatthu, his prediction of the Buddha’s destiny, his joy
that an Enlightened One has been born into the world, and his grief that he
himself will soon die and thus miss the opportunity to hear the liberating
Dhamma.
The thread that connects the vatthugāthā with the body of the poem is
the advice he gives his nephew Nālaka, mentioned at the end of the
background story (695-98). He tells Nālaka that when he hears that the
Buddha has begun his mission, he should seek him out and lead the spiritual
life under him. At this point the background story gives way to the body of
the discourse, which must be set at least thirty-five years later, after theBuddha has attained buddhahood. Now Nālaka meets the Master face to
face and asks for an explanation of munihood.
On the basis of language, style, meter, content, and external evidence,
Jayawickrama holds that the vatthugāthā are considerably later than the
discourse to Nālaka, which he takes to be the archaic core of the sutta. He
contends (PBR 1978, 17) that “the two parts of the sutta known as the
Nālaka Sutta in Sn are in reality two independent poems differing in age,
brought together at a subsequent date which, most probably, coincided with
that of the final collation of Sn.” The vatthugāthā certainly show signs of
lateness. Their language is more ornate and they abound in metaphor,
simile, and poetic conceits in a way that distinguishes them from the more
vigorous and plainer verse style of the older canonical poems. However,
while as a literary document the vatthugāthā may be younger than the body
of the poem, the connection between Asita and Nālaka could well have
been historical and thus the vatthugāthā could have a factual root. Texts
from other schools of Early Buddhism also testify to the relationship
between Asita and a younger nephew whom he advised to visit the Buddha,
and while names and details may differ between diverse accounts, the -
correspondence between them on the core issue suggests they spring from a
common source. This could have been an oral narrative that told about the
actual relationship between the aged sage who prophesied the newborn
infant’s attainment of buddhahood and the younger nephew he advised to
become his disciple. When introducing himself to the Buddha (at 699),
Nālaka refers to Asita, which establishes a connection between the body of
the sutta and the background story.
When Nālaka finally meets the Buddha, he does not simply ask to
become a monk but frames his question as an inquiry about moneyya, the
state of a muni, and the practice to attain the state of a muni. In response the
Buddha explains in detail the practice prescribed for a bhikkhu intent on
winning the goal in this very life. In the light of the distinction made above
(pp. 45–46) between aspirant munis and accomplished munis, the course of
practice described is that of an aspirant muni training to become an
accomplished muni. The training is quite different from the more gradual
process the Buddha generally suggests to newly ordained monks. Theguidance must have been intended for a disciple of mature spiritual faculties
ready to make the steep ascent toward the peak of realization.
Hence at the outset the Buddha warns Nālaka that he is about to
describe a training that is “hard to practice and hard to master,” one for
which “you must brace yourself and be firm” (701). The verses instruct the
ascetic to maintain equanimity whether insulted or venerated, to remain on
guard against the lure of attractive women, to conduct himself properly on
alms round, to eat in moderation, to look impartially on what he receives,
and to resort to solitary places suitable for meditation. The poem
specifically recommends living in the woods and staying at the foot of a
tree (708). It does not insist on vows of strict silence — the idea that
moneyya (or mauna) conveys in later Indian tradition — but it does
inculcate restraint in speech, for “creeks flow on noisily, but silently the
great rivers flow” (720).
Parallels from other traditions: Sanskrit: Mvu III 386–89;
Saṅghabhedavastu (Gnoli 1:52–55, vatthugāthā only)
III,12 Contemplation of Dyads (Dvayatānupassanā Sutta), verses
724–65
This is the only strictly doctrinal discourse in the whole of the Suttanipāta.
Jayawickrama (PBR 1976, 161) regards it as one of the youngest suttas in
the work, along with the Vijaya and Ratana Suttas. Apart from its language
and content, he sees a sign of its lateness in its position at the end of the
Mahāvagga, since late accretions to a chapter tend to be placed either at its
beginning or its end. It is also the only sutta in Sn that unambiguously
mentions the teaching of non-self under its familiar name, anattā.
Elsewhere the need to free oneself from assumptions of self are expressed
as injunctions to stop grasping upon things as one’s own, to put an end to
mamāyita and mamatta (see pp. 65–66), without an explicit doctrinal
underpinning.
The sutta takes up sixteen topics of Buddhist doctrine, each of which it
bifurcates for the purpose of contemplation. The method of dividing a given
topic into pairs is what accounts for the title. The text is composed in mixed
prose and verse, with the alternation of prose passages and verses
conforming to a fixed format. After the first section, which follows directlyfrom the announcement of the theme, the Buddha raises the question in the
prose portion whether there is another way of contemplating things
arranged in dyads. He then answers positively and explains the particular
dyad. This is followed by the verse portion, which treats the same topic in a
more inspirational and edifying way. The verses usually occur in pairs, to
match the two sides of the dyad, though in some sections more than a single
verse is needed to adequately articulate how to contemplate that side of the
dyad.
The first section takes up the four noble truths, which it divides
according to whether they pertain to the origination of suffering or to its
cessation. The first two truths are subsumed under the first portion, the
second two truths under the second. The next section frames the dyad in
terms of acquisitions (upadhi), a word with several nuances. Although the
commentary identifies upadhi here with kamma, I think it more likely refers
to either the defilements or the five aggregates. All suffering, the text states,
is conditioned by acquisitions; with the cessation of acquisitions suffering
does not arise.
The same pattern is employed for seven factors in the familiar
twelvefold series of dependent origination. Since the verses on the last
factor, clinging, speak of existence, birth, and death, altogether they
comprise ten factors of the series. The only two that are missing are name-
and-form and the six sense bases. Pj II offers an explanation, which is not
fully convincing, and this raises the suspicion that two sections could have
been lost in the process of oral transmission. Unfortunately, there is as yet
no known parallel of this sutta from other traditions against which to check
it.
Several more sections follow that do not directly fall under the formula
of dependent origination. The first is about “instigations” (ārambha), a term
Pj II defines as “energy associated with kamma,” but which I would
conjecture here probably means endeavors motivated by craving. This is
followed by nutriment, disturbance or agitation (injita), dependency, form
and formless states, truth and falsity, and happiness and suffering. In the
verses on truth and falsity (756–58), it is said that the world conceives a self
in what is not-self (anattani attamāniṃ), imagining name-and-form to betrue. The noble ones, in contrast, know nibbāna to be truth, of an
undeceptive nature (amosadhammaṃ nibbānaṃ, tadariyā saccato vidū).
IV THE CHAPTER OF OCTADS (AṬṬHAKAVAGGA)
The Aṭṭhakavagga, as was stated earlier, existed as a separate collection
before it became part of the Suttanipāta. It is mentioned in the texts of other
schools of Early Buddhism. There is a Chinese parallel titled 義⾜經, “The
Discourse of Verses on Meaning,” which is assumed to be a translation of a
Skt title, *Arthapada Sūtra. An English translation is available (Bapat
1951), which also cites parallel verses from Sn. Another Skt form of the
title, mentioned in other works, is Arthavargīya. The difference in titles
between the Pāli and the Skt stems from an original ambiguity. The Skt
word artha can be rendered into a Prakrit like Pāli either as attha, which
means “meaning, good, benefit,” or as aṭṭha, which can mean either
“meaning” or “eight.” The suffix –ka turns the simple number into a group
number. The Chinese version was evidently based on an original that
construed the sense as artha, “beneficial, meaningful.” The Pāli tradition
took the sense as aṭṭhaka or “eights,” since four of the suttas in the chapter
contain eight stanzas.57
The order of the first nine suttas is the same in both the Pāli and Chinese
versions; it is only the last seven that differ slightly in position. The
relationship is as follows, with the Pāli followed by the Chinese: 10 = 15;
11 = 10; 12 = 11; 13 = 12; 14 = 13; 15 = 16; 16 = 14. The two also differ in
that the verses of the Chinese version are embedded in prose background
stories, whereas the Pāli tradition has assigned the background stories to the
commentary. This difference sheds some light on other suttas in mixed
prose and verse in Sn, where the background story may originally have
been an informal oral narrative that was later absorbed into the sutta.58
The chapter consists of sixteen suttas, composed entirely in verse. The
number of stanzas in each sutta increases progressively from six in the first
to twenty-one in the last. Several of these suttas differ only in nuance,
treating the same topic from slightly different angles. Since their motifs and
phrasing overlap and reverberate from one to the others, rather thansummarize each individually I will discuss them collectively, drawing out
their common nucleus.
The unifying theme behind these discourses is the detached stance the
sage takes toward debates and doctrinal views. The following suttas
articulate this theme:
IV,3 The Octad on the Hostile (Duṭṭhaṭṭhaka Sutta), verses 780–87
IV,4 The Octad on the Pure (Suddhaṭṭhaka Sutta), verses 788–95
IV,5 The Octad on the Supreme (Paramaṭṭhaka Sutta), verses 796–
803
IV,8 Pasūra (Pasūra Sutta), verses 824–34
IV,9 Māgandiya (Māgandiya Sutta), verses 835–47
IV,12 The Smaller Discourse on Deployment (Cūḷaviyūha Sutta),
verses 878–94
IV,13 The Greater Discourse on Deployment (Mahāviyūha Sutta),
verses 895–914
Sutta IV,11 begins on a similar note and thus partly belongs to this group,
but it unfolds in accordance with a trajectory peculiar to itself that calls for
separate treatment.
The suttas in this class take a critical attitude toward the dogmatic
adherence to philosophical views. Their message dovetails with the prose
suttas in the main Nikāyas in which the Buddha refuses to endorse any of
the speculative views circulating among the thinkers of his time. In the
Cūḷamāluṅkya Sutta (MN 63), he says that such views are not connected
with the fundamentals of the spiritual life. In the Aggivacchagotta Sutta
(MN 72), he calls such views a thicket, a wilderness, a contortion, and a
fetter. In the Vacchagottasaṃyutta (SN chap. 33) and the Avyākatasaṃyutta
(SN chap. 44), he explains that such views arise because of a failure to
understand the true nature of the five aggregates and the six sense bases.
The Brahmajāla Sutta (DN 1) weaves a net of sixty-two speculative views,
which the Buddha declares to be vain imaginings arisen from craving and
ignorance. At stream-entry, the first stage of the path, the disciple eradicates
the latent tendency to views, the fetter of personal-entity view, clinging to
views, the knot of dogmatic adherence to views, the flood of views, and theyoke of views. Hence the critical stance on views characteristic of the
Aṭṭhakavagga is in no way unique to that collection but an expression of the
same attitude found in the prose suttas, but here delivered in the heightened
and evocative language of verse.
The Aṭṭhakavagga depicts an era when intense debates were held among
rival ascetics and brahmins, who would vie with one another in the debate
arena in the hope of proving the superiority of their own doctrines and
thereby winning converts. The discourses in this chapter sometimes
describe how the disciple in training should act in relation to such debates;
sometimes they describe the outlook of the accomplished sage, the muni or
enlightened brahmin. For the disciple in training the discourses have a
prescriptive force, urging one who aspires for sagehood to avoid debates
over views. For the sage, such discourses are descriptive, depicting one who
naturally avoids wrangling over views. Stanzas that pertain to both can be
found in the same poem, and sometimes verses are ambivalent about their
subject.
The Buddha’s critical perspective on debates over views can be
considered from two angles, one epistemological and the other
psychological. The epistemological critique stems from the fact that
although “truth is one,” without a second, few recognize the unitary truth.
Those who fail to understand the truth fall back on their raw perceptions in
their efforts to understand the nature of reality. Since their perceptions are
tainted by subjective biases, their convictions about truth reflect their
predilections. Having fallen into the duality of “true” and “false” (886), the
proponents of views spar over their conflicting standpoints, advancing their
own views and attacking those of their opponents. This, however, inevitably
draws them into an epistemological impasse. Each considers his own
opinion to be true and the views of his opponents to be false; each considers
the opponents to be fools, and each takes himself to be wise. However,
since they are each in the same position relative to the others, it follows that
their opinions would be either all true or all false, that the disputants would
be either all fools or all sages (880–82; see too 903–4).
The disputants do not merely cherish elevated opinions about the
validity of their views. Even more, they personally identify with their
views, staking their identities and self-esteem on their convictions about thetruth. It is from this personal investment in their positions that the
psychological danger in views becomes manifest. The danger erupts when
theorists engage in debate. The Pasūra Sutta depicts this situation with a
delicate touch of humor. It sketches the stages through which a disputant
passes as the debate progresses, from the self-confidence with which he
enters the arena through the turmoil he experiences as his arguments falter:
“Wishing for praise, he becomes anxious. If his assertion is rejected, he
feels humiliated. Upset by blame, he seeks a flaw” (826). Even success is
no guarantee against a fall; for the pride that comes with victory is the
ground of his distress (830a).
Beyond the personal anguish that comes from debates — the exaltation
from winning, the dejection from losing — there is a more profound reason
the Aṭṭhakavagga cautions against adherence to views. Views are
symptomatic of a deeply rooted sense of insecurity and a compulsive need
to establish a base of security to allay the anxiety. This is particularly the
case regarding the content of the kind of views the Buddha was most
concerned with: the self and its objective counterpart, the world. Since the
self is actually a fiction, a mere mental construct, views about the self are
always trailed by an inseparable shadow of agitation — anguish that the
inner absence of selfhood might come to light. The agitation is kept at bay
by adhering to views and indulging in craving. Because they suppress the
underlying agitation, views create a dependency (877). It is for this reason
that attachment to them “is not easily overcome” (785a). If one view proves
inadequate, one drops it and takes up another view. As the text says: “They
grab hold and let go, like a monkey grasping and letting go of a branch”
(791cd).
Recognizing the danger, the muni “does not create a dependency even
by knowledge” (800b). He has no dependencies, no craving for existence or
nonexistence (856). Hence “the muni does not become involved in an arisen
dispute” (780c). Instead of entangling themselves in views, the wise
“loosen the knot of grasping, and they do not form desires for anything in
the world” (794cd). “A brahmin” — a true sage — “does not take up mental
constructs; he is not a pursuer of views nor a kinsman of knowledge”
(911ab). Thus “he maintains equanimity while others grasp” (911d); he is
“peaceful among the restless, equanimous, without grasping while othersgrasp” (912cd). Aloof from all such convictions, the sage “sees security
everywhere” (khemaṃ passati sabbadhi, 953d).
Since one ranks oneself in relation to others on the basis of one’s views,
attachment to views is closely bound up with conceit (māna), with
positioning oneself in terms of the three discriminations: as superior, equal,
or inferior. Those who think in this way, the text says, engage in disputes.
The wise, in contrast, do not “shake among these three discriminations”
(842). Since the muni does not proclaim himself superior, equal, or inferior,
“he is peaceful, without miserliness, and does not take, does not reject”
(954).
The basis on which views arise, according to the Aṭṭhakavagga, is said
to be “the seen, heard, and sensed, good behavior and observances” (diṭṭha,
suta, muta, sīlabbata). Elsewhere the first three terms are accompanied by a
fourth, “the cognized” (viññāta), to represent the entire objective domain of
experience: the objects of sight, hearing, the other senses, and inner
reflection.59 In the Aṭṭhakavagga, where only the three terms are used, it
seems “the sensed” includes the cognized.60 Sīlabbata comprises all the
modes of conduct and observances that brahmins and ascetics adopted as
part of their disciplines. The expression sīlabbata occurs among the ten
fetters and four kinds of clinging to be eradicated along the path to
liberation. The term probably includes the rites and sacrifices of the
brahmins as well as the types of self-mortification pursued by ascetics.
The Buddha advocates detachment toward these objective bases of
views. A bhikkhu in training “should not be attached to the seen, the heard
or sensed, or to behavior and observances” (798cd). The sage “does not
speak of purity by the seen and heard, by behavior and observances, by the
sensed” (790ab); rather, he keeps “remote from all phenomena, from
whatever is seen, heard, or sensed” (793ab) and “does not posit even a
subtle notion about what is seen, heard, or sensed here” (802ab). The
Aṭṭhakavagga thus teaches not only a pragmatic refusal to engage in debates
about views but a radical rejection of views themselves, declaring: “One
should not construct any view in the world by means of knowledge or good
behavior and observances” (799ab). The wise “do not fall back on any view
at all” (800d); even dhammas, the teachings, “are not embraced by them”
(803b).Such statements, taken out of context, can be misconstrued to mean that
the practitioner must be ready to give up all views, including those usually
identified as Buddhist. If all views are an impediment, it might be said, this
must be true of Buddhist views as well, which are just a more refined type
of clinging. Consistency therefore requires a suspension of conviction even
about those teachings described elsewhere under the rubric of “right view”:
the views about kamma and rebirth, the three characteristics, the four noble
truths, and other matters outside the range of immediate empirical
observation.
If such arguments were correct, the Buddha would wind up advocating a
complete agnosticism regarding the possibilities of super-sensory cognition.
In that case the goal of his teaching would hardly differ from that of the
ataraxia of Pyrrhonic skepticism: the tranquility that can be attained by
suspending all attempts to arrive at epistemic certainty. Such arguments,
however, fail to properly understand the nature and function of right view in
the Buddha’s path. Right view is “right” because it articulates matters seen
and understood as true by the Buddha and accomplished sages. These
matters are not merely of speculative interest but have a profound bearing
on human well-being and happiness. As the tenth wholesome course of
kamma, right view illuminates the moral lawfulness of the universe,
showing how our actions eventually rebound upon us either for our benefit
or our harm. As the first factor of the noble eightfold path, right view
reveals the principles that must be penetrated with wisdom in order to
realize the ultimate goal.
Right view differs from the kind of views repudiated in the
Aṭṭhakavagga in that it is offered not as an object of intellectual consent but
as a guideline to experiential insight. Right view serves a pragmatic
function, disclosing truths relevant to our genuine well-being, both temporal
and ultimate. The Buddha compares the Dhamma to a raft, which is for the
purpose of crossing over, not for the purpose of grasping.61 Right view is a
component of that raft, the compass that guides the traveler to the other
shore. The raft is not to be carried around on one’s head, but it has to be
used to get across. In a similar vein, the Aṭṭhakavagga subjects right view to
a subtle dialectic. On the one hand, it says, purity is not to be achieved by
view, learning, knowledge, and good behavior; on the other, it adds, puritycannot be achieved “without view, without learning, without knowledge,
without behavior, without observances” (839). Right view and all its
accessories are like carriages for arriving at the goal; they are not the goal
itself (see MN I 149–50). Thus the enlightened sage, unlike the
philosophical skeptic, is not committed to a perpetual aporia. What
distinguishes the munis of the Aṭṭhakavagga is that, having fulfilled the
function of right view, they do not grasp upon views and thus they abide in
peace and equanimity.
The suttas of the Aṭṭhakavagga that lie outside this group concerned with
the relinquishment of views may be summarized very briefly.
IV,1 Sensual Pleasures (Kāma Sutta), verses 766–71
This is a simple homily on the dangers in sensual pleasures, urging the
disciple to avoid them “like a serpent’s head with the foot.”
IV,2 The Octad on the Cave (Guhaṭṭhaka Sutta), verses 772–79
This sutta begins almost as a sequel to its predecessor, reiterating its
message that sensual pleasures are a source of suffering. At 776, the
discourse drops to a deeper level, moving from attachment to sensual
pleasures to a more tenacious type of craving, “craving for states of
existence.” This is coupled with the habit of grasping upon things as “mine”
(777), because of which people tremble like fish in a dried-up stream. To
win freedom, one must stop taking things as “mine” and discard attachment
even to existence. Release comes through insight into the process by which
attachment is created. By fully understanding contact one is freed from
greed (778b); by fully understanding perception one crosses the flood
(779ab).
IV,6 Old Age (Jarā Sutta), verses 804–13
This sutta begins with a reflection on the transience of life and the
inevitable separation from everyone and everything one loves. Since there
are no permanent possessions, it says, one should not live the household life
(805cd). In 807–8, the poem moves from material possessions to lovedones, who vanish from one’s sight at death like images seen in a dream; all
that remains of them is their name. At 809, the poem turns into a eulogy of
the muni, who takes the message to heart and abandons possessions. Stanza
810 uses the word “bhikkhu” in place of muni, showing that in some
contexts the two are interchangeable. Stanza 811 compares the muni to a
lotus leaf and stanza 812 to the lotus flower, for he remains untainted by
things seen, heard, and sensed just as the lotus remains untainted by mud.
IV,7 Tissa Metteyya (Tissametteyya Sutta), verses 814–23
This is a diatribe on indulgence in sexual intercourse, spoken in response to
the question of a bhikkhu named Tissa Metteyya. The teaching here, it
seems, is intended for a renunciant who reverts from celibacy to the
enjoyment of sexual pleasures. At 821, it turns into another acclamation of
the muni, who lives alone, indifferent to sensual pleasures, and thereby
crosses the flood (823).
IV,10 Before the Breakup (Purābheda Sutta), verses 848–61
The commentary explains that this sutta and the five that follow — the
Kalahavivāda, the Cūḷaviyūha, the Mahāvyūha, the Tuvaṭaka, and the
Attadaṇḍa — were taught at the Great Gathering, like the
Sammāparibbājaniya Sutta (II,13). Each of these discourses, says the
commentary, was intended for a different group of deities and was taught in
response to questions asked by a mind-created buddha. The Purābheda
Sutta was delivered for the sake of devas who had given rise to the thought:
“What should be done before the dissolution of the body?” The Early
Buddhist traditions are not unanimous about this account. In the origin story
behind the parallel version in the Chinese Arthapada, the questions are
asked by the Buddha’s father, the Sakyan Suddhodana. In any case, the
discourse makes perfect sense as the response the Buddha might have given
to questions asked by any inquisitive bhikkhu.
The question that inspires the discourse asks about the knowledge and
conduct of the supreme person (uttamaṃ naraṃ), one who dwells at peace
(upasanto). The reply offers a description of the muni, who is “a seer of
seclusion in the midst of contacts” and thus free from defilements.IV,11 Quarrels and Disputes (Kalahavivāda Sutta), verses 862–77
This sutta follows an alternating question-and-response pattern, where the
questioner poses one verse and the respondent answers. The next question
picks up on the response and carries the inquiry further. The sequence
unfolds in a chain that proceeds from the more manifest level of effects to
the more subtle level of conditions. The series thus constitutes an
application of the principle of dependent origination to a process different
from that described by the familiar twelvefold formula.
The sutta begins with a question about the origin of quarrels and
disputes and proceeds to trace back the chain of conditions. Allowing for
some oversimplification, the series from 862 to 872 might be depicted as
follows: quarrels and disputes
what is dear
desire
the pleasant and
unpleasant contact name and form. At this point, the respondent says,
“When form has vanished, contacts do not touch one,” which elicits a
question about the attainment where form vanishes (873). There follows a
cryptic stanza (874), probably intended as a riddle, about the attainment
where form vanishes. The questioner then asks whether this is “the
foremost purity of the spirit” and points to an alternative thesis about “an
attainment without residue remaining.” Though this phrase is ordinarily
used to describe the ultimate dimension of nibbāna, here the respondent
rejects both positions as “dependencies,” probably to underscore that the
two sides are taken up as views. He then states that the liberated muni does
not enter disputes and does not encounter various states of existence (875–
77).
IV,14 Quickly (Tuvaṭaka Sutta), verses 915–34
The questioner asks the Buddha: “How, having seen, does a bhikkhu attain
nibbāna?” In response, the Buddha explains the contemplative practice of a
bhikkhu, urging him to check the conceit “I am” and remove craving (916–
20). From this high level the questioner reverts to a more rudimentary stage
of training and asks the Buddha to speak about monastic discipline and
concentration. The Buddha (starting at 922) responds with a detailed
account of the bhikkhu’s training, describing his deportment, his attitude
toward food and clothes, his mental cultivation, his livelihood, and his
speech.IV,15 One Who Has Taken Up the Rod (Attadaṇḍa Sutta), verses
935–54
While the commentary, in its introduction to the Purābheda Sutta (Pj II
548), says that the Attadaṇḍa Sutta was spoken to the deities at the Great
Gathering, in its introduction to the Attadaṇḍa it says the discourse was
taught by the Buddha to the Sakyans and the Koliyans, who were preparing
to wage war over the water of the Rohini River, which both states needed to
irrigate their crops. The Chinese Arthapada gives still a different origin
story, relating it to the massacre of the Sakyans by Virūḍhaka, the rogue
king of Kosala.
The sutta seems to be constituted by two sections that sit loosely
together. The opening five stanzas are a testament of conscience expressing
revulsion at the horrors of mass violence. According to the commentary,
these verses were spoken by the Buddha with reference to the time he was a
bodhisatta, when he could still experience agitation and distress. The
speaker says that he was stirred by a sense of urgency (935), experienced
fear (936), and was overcome by inner disorientation (937). At 940, a voice
interrupts, saying “There the trainings are recited,” at which point the
stanzas that follow (940–45) describe the training of a bhikkhu in familiar
ways. Then at 946 the poem launches into an extended praise of the muni,
which continues to the end of the discourse.
IV,16 Sāriputta (Sāriputta Sutta), verses 955–75
The commentary explains that this sutta was initiated by the chief disciple
Sāriputta when the Buddha returned to the human world after spending the
rains retreat among the devas. The first two verses sing praise of the
Buddha, after which Sāriputta announces that he has come with a question;
the commentary explains that he is asking on behalf of his pupils. From
958–62 he actually asks not one question but a multitude of questions
pertaining to the training of a bhikkhu. In the remainder of the sutta (962–
75) the Buddha explains the various aspects of monastic training: the fears a
bhikkhu must overcome, the afflictions he must endure, his moral conduct,
his cultivation of mind, how he should deport himself, and how he should
investigate the Dhamma.Parallels from other traditions: see Appendix 1
V THE CHAPTER ON THE WAY TO THE BEYOND (PĀRĀYANAVAGGA)
Like the Aṭṭhakavagga, the Pārāyanavagga once existed as an independent
collection before it was incorporated into the Suttanipāta, and like the
Aṭṭhakavagga, it is alluded to a number of times in the main Nikāyas (see
pp. 29–30). The chapter is divided into three major sections: the
vatthugāthā or introductory verses, the pucchās or questions (inclusive of
the Buddha’s replies), and an epilogue, partly in prose and partly in verse.
Some of the stanzas in the epilogue display the same style as the
vatthugāthā and must have been added by the compilers; others are
composed in the more archaic style of the pucchās and are probably integral
to the original work. The commentary uses the word sutta to designate the
sixteen sections with the questions and replies, but the canonical text
merely calls each one a pucchā, “a question.”
The vatthugāthā (976–1031) purport to narrate the background story to
the pucchās. The central figure of the story is a brahmin named Bāvari who
had established a hermitage in the south. One day, after supervising a
sacrifice, he returned to his hermitage to find that a seedy-looking brahmin
had arrived. The brahmin asks Bāvari for money. When Bāvari tells him
that he had distributed all his wealth at the sacrifice, the brahmin becomes
angry and curses him, declaring that in seven days his head will split into
seven pieces. Bāvari believes the swindler and becomes despondent. Just
then a benevolent deity appears to him and tells him that the visitor was a
charlatan and that the only one who knows about heads and head-splitting is
the Buddha, who is living in far-off Sāvatthī. Bāvari, however, is too old
and weak to travel the distance to meet the Buddha himself, so he
dispatches his sixteen pupils, who, the commentary says, are each
accompanied by their own retinues. Traveling north, passing through city
after city, they finally catch up with the Buddha at the Pāsāṇaka Cetiya near
Rājagaha. After testing the Buddha to ascertain that he is the Enlightened
One, the leader of the group, Ajita, asks the question about heads and head-
splitting, which the Buddha answers to their satisfaction. The Buddha theninvites the sixteen students of Bāvari to ask about any matters that perplex
them, at which point the vatthugāthā give way to the pucchās.
It is widely recognized by scholars that the vatthugāthā stem from a
considerably later period than the pucchās. One piece of evidence for this is
the Cūḷaniddesa, the canonical commentary on the Pārāyanavagga. Though
all editions of the Cūḷaniddesa include the vatthugāthā in the full text of the
Pārāyana at the beginning of the work, the expository section does not
comment on the introductory verses but only on the pucchās. This suggests
either that the vatthugāthā did not exist at the time the Cūḷaniddesa was
composed or the author(s) of the exposition did not consider this portion
canonical.62
Though the text of the Suttanipāta that has come down joins the
vatthugāthā and the pucchās into an integral whole, the two are not
indissolubly bound together. It is possible that the story of Bāvari originated
as a legend that was later attached to the pucchās as the preamble to a well-
known collection of discussions between a group of ascetics and the
Buddha on “the way to the beyond.” The quaintness of the story stands in
stark contrast to the simplicity and sobriety of the pucchās. Following the
vatthugāthā Bāvari is not explicitly mentioned again, and the inquirers
seem to come from a contemplative tradition quite different from that of a
brahmin devoted to sacrificial rites. Among the inquirers, only one,
Puṇṇaka, asks about sacrifice, a brahmanic concern.
Nevertheless, several of the verses in the pucchās use the word
brāhmaṇa in a favorable sense. At 1059a the word is conjoined with
vedagū, another brahmanic term, to describe a liberated sage. Dhotaka calls
the Buddha a brahmin (1063b), and the Buddha addresses Jātukaṇṇī in the
same way (1100b). In his discourse to Posāla, the Buddha speaks of the real
knowledge of the brahmin attained by insight (1115f). Moreover, in the
epilogue Piṅgiya, conversing with an unnamed inquirer (whom Pj II
identifies as Bāvari), addresses him as brāhmaṇa three times (1140b, 1142b,
1144d). Thus, while the colorful background story may have been added to
awaken interest in the poems to follow, there seems no compelling reason to
reject the tradition that sixteen students of a brahmin named Bāvari came to
see the Buddha to inquire about the “way to the beyond.”Bāvari himself may have been not a ritual specialist but a contemplative
brahmin of the kind described at AN III 224–25 as “one who is like
Brahmā.” In that case, his pupils would have been similar, celibates
dedicated to the meditative life. It is possible, too, that his pupils included
both khattiyas and brahmins, like the sages of the Upanishads.63 It is
conceivable that Bāvari even had a connection with Āḷāra Kālāma, the
Buddha’s first meditation teacher. While the text of the Pārāyana does not
give any direct indication of this, it does drop two inconclusive clues. When
Upasīva asks the Buddha how he can cross the flood, the Buddha tells him
to contemplate nothingness supported by “there is not” (1070ab). Again, the
inquirer Posāla asks about the knowledge of one for whom form has
vanished, “who sees ‘there is nothing’ internally and externally.” The
Buddha replies that one knows the origin of nothingness and then sees it
with insight (1113–15). It was under Āḷāra that the Buddha mastered the
meditative attainment of the base of nothingness. If Bāvari knew that the
Buddha was Āḷāra’s former student, as news about the Buddha and the
success of his ministry spread among the ascetic circles of the time, he
might have sent his own pupils, several attainers of the base of nothingness,
to go meet the Buddha to find out what he had realized and to clarify their
own doubts about the way to the beyond. Aware of their meditative
experience, the Buddha might have drawn on this to guide them a few steps
further to the final goal. While this hypothesis is purely speculative, it
seems far more plausible than what the narrative story tells us, that learned
brahmins would have traveled a long distance to see the Buddha just to ask
about head-splitting.
The pucchās themselves inquire into profound matters relating to
bondage and liberation. The unifying theme, as indicated by the chapter
title, might be summed up in the question: “What is the way to the
beyond?” In the verses, the expression “going to the beyond” appears less
often than the cognate expression, “crossing over”: crossing the flood,
crossing over birth and old age, crossing over attachment to the world (see
pp. 51–52).
Each pucchā section poses its own questions. There are, however,
affinities and resonances among the questions asked by the different
inquirers. The questions might be concisely summarized as follows:V,1 Ajita (1032–39): By what is the world shrouded? What is its
great peril? What is the blocking and closing off of the streams
(of craving)?
V,2 Tissa Metteyya (1040–42): Who is contented in the world?
Who transcends the seamstress (craving)?
V,3 Puṇṇaka (1043–48): For what reason do people perform
sacrifices to the deities? Who in the world has crossed over birth
and old age?
V,4 Mettagū (1049–60): From where does suffering arise? How
do the wise cross over the flood of birth and old age, sorrow and
lamenting?
V,5 Dhotaka (1061–68): Instruct me in the state of seclusion so
that I can live peaceful and unattached. How can one cross over
attachment to the world?
V,6 Upasīva (1069–76): Declare to me a basis by which I might
cross this flood. Does one who has gone out cease to exist or does
he remain through all eternity?
V,7 Nanda (1077–83): Is a muni one who has knowledge or one
following a particular way of life? Who in the world has crossed
over birth and old age?
V,8 Hemaka (1084–87): Declare the destruction of craving,
having understood which one can cross over attachment to the
world.
V,9 Todeyya (1088–91): What is the emancipation of one in
whom craving is not found?
V,10 Kappa (1092–95): Declare an island for those standing in the
midst of the stream, oppressed by old age and death.V,11 Jatukaṇṇī (1096–1100): Speak about the state of peace as it
actually is.
V,12 Bhadrāvudha (1101–4): Explain matters well to the people
here who desire to hear your word.
V,13 Udaya (1105–11): What is emancipation by final knowledge,
the breaking up of ignorance? By what is the world fettered?
What must be abandoned to attain nibbāna?
V,14 Posāla (1112–15): What is the knowledge of one for whom
perception of form has vanished, who sees “there is nothing”
internally and externally?
V,15 Mogharāja (1116–19): How does one look upon the world so
that the King of Death does not see one?
V,16 Piṅgiya (1120–23): Declare the abandoning here of birth and
old age.
The Pārāyana ends with an epilogue in mixed prose and verse. Here an
inquirer (who the commentary says was Bāvari) asks the elderly Piṅgiya
why, when he has met the Buddha and accepted his Dhamma, he does not
constantly follow him. Piṅgiya replies, in devotional verses of great beauty,
that although he is separated from the Buddha physically, he is always
united with him in mind (mano hi me tena yutto).
