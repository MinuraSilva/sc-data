The Suttanipāta is the fifth book of the Khuddaka Nikāya of the Pali canon. It is mainly verse, with a few prose sections, mostly for narrative background. 

The poems are vivid, personal, and direct. There is little of the flowery adornment that characterized later Buddhist literature. And the verse form leaves out much of the repetition that can seem so ponderous when reading the prose texts. The texts are highly concentrated; a little has a lot of flavour. 

The Suttanipāta is, so far as we know, unique to the Pali tradition. There are no parallels to the book as a whole in the Tibetan or Chinese canons, nor any references to it in the northern traditions. 

There are, however, many parallels to specific verses or sections of the text; among others, the Ratana Sutta, Khaggavisāṇa Sutta, and Aṭṭhakavagga have important parallels. Several of the texts, such as the Sela Sutta, are found elsewhere in the Pali canon. And, as always, individual verses are widely shared across the many verse collections found in all schools of Buddhism.

The Suttanipāta has a unique structure, in that it is comprised (almost) entirely of *poems*, that is, coherent sets of verses. Often Buddhist verse collections consist of assemblages of individual verses loosely connected by theme (Dhammapada), or verses associated with a prose background story (Udāna, Jātaka). In the Thera- and Therīgāthā, verses are collected because of their association with a given monk or nun. Among these are some coherent poems, but we also find individual verses or clusters of verses with no particular relation to others under the same pwerson. Perhaps the closest literary cousin of the Suttanipāta would be the Sagāthā Vagga of the Saṁyutta Nikāya, which likewise consists of various sets of verses, often in dialogue form, and with a minimal narrative background. Several of the Suttanipāta texts are in fact shared with the Sagāthā Vagga, such as the Kasi-Bhāradvāja Sutta (Snp 1.4).

The poems of the Suttanipāta are, like all early Buddhist texts, organized in_vaggas_, that is, chapters of roughly ten texts. Unusually, all the vaggas of Suttanipāta consist of more than ten texts. 

The first three vaggas have only slender thematic connections. However the final two chapters are fairly tightly knit, and evidently were self-contained collections that were added to the Suttanipāta. They are referred to by name in several places in the prose Suttas, and the Aṭṭhakavagga has a version in the Chinese canon. These chapters, together with certain other texts such as the Khaggavisāṇa Sutta, show certain signs of being old texts, such as archaic vocabulary and metrical forms. This has led to the oft-repeated claim that the Suttanipāta is a uniquely early text. It is not. Many of the poems in the Suttanipāta are not especially early, and some of them are quite late, notably the opening verses of the Nālaka Sutta (Snp 3.11). 

Even in the cases of the early verses, there is no compelling reason to consider them as any earlier than the prose Suttas. And these sections are themselves comprised of elements of differing periods; the Introduction to the Pārāyana Vagga, for example, is later than the questions that follow it.

Since the collection is primarily organized by literary style rather than topic, it contains texts on a wide variety of themes. These themes are familiar elsewhere in Buddhist texts, and I will briefly summarize them here.

- The virtues of renunciation and the proper life of the ascetic (eg. Snp 1.1, Snp 1.3)
- Ethical virtues and dangers (eg. Snp 1.6, Snp 1.7)
- Revaluation of contemporary, often Brahmanical, views (eg. Snp 1.4, Snp 2.7)
- Conversion of native deities (Snp 1.9, Snp 1.10, Snp 2.5)
- The virtues of the Buddha and Triple Gem (eg. Snp 2.1, Snp 3.7)
- Biography (eg. Snp 3.1, Snp 3.2, Snp 3.10, Snp 3.11, Snp 4.15)
- Meditation and mental development (eg. Snp 1.8, Snp 1.11, Snp 2.10)
- Philosophy, especially of causation and not-self (eg. Snp 3.12, Snp 4.11)
- Letting go of disputatious views (eg. Snp 4.3, Snp 4.12, Snp 4.13)

I would add a word of caution against over-interpreting the text. Perhaps the most striking themes, sometimes taken as emblematic of the collection as a whole, are the first and last in the above list: the virtues of renunciation, and the dangers of disputatious views. If one assumes that the Suttanipāta is a uniquely archaic text, it is tempting to see these positions as more authentic to the Buddha’s orginal teachings than what is found in the bulk of the prose texts. I don’t think this is the case. The virtue of renunciation and a simple wandering life is mentioned in many places in the prose Suttas, as is the danger of getting involved in disputations based on theoretical views. Perhaps they are emphasized more in the Suttanipāta, but this is hardly a sign of any substantially different doctrine. It is a mistake to develop a theory of Early Buddhism based on a few verses.

There is no overall thematic development in the text, so the reader can start wherever they like. The only exception is the final chapter, which is one long Sutta and should be read as a whole.

## The Snake Chapter

The chapter offers advice for lay folk, counters the pretensions of the brahmins, and co-opts the animist worship of native spirits. But it begins and ends with a direct statement on the life that the Buddha believed to be most worth living: a mendicant who “sheds this world and the next”, “the sage meditating secluded in the woods”.

While the structure of the chapter is certainly loose, I think this return suggests that it was compiled with an overall plan in mind. 

### The Snake

The collection as a whole opens with a series of verses based on the extended metaphor of a snake shedding its skin. The form seems to be an old and popular one, as there are parallels for this Sutta found in the Gāndhārī Dharmapada, Patna Dhammapada, and Udānavarga. A comparative study by Ven Ānandajoti concluded that verses 6 and 10–13 in the Pali were likely added later, for they are not found in the parallels

For myself, and for many readers, we encounter these metaphors from the safety of our comfortable homes. Even in Australia—and I’m sorry to disappoint—it isn’t really the case that deadly snakes are lurking in every bathroom. In urban settings it’s easy to forget just how dangerous snakes really are, but they still kill around 58,000 people per year in India. 

So while we might relate to a snake sentimentally, appreciating its cool elegance, for the mendicants living in the forests 2,500 years ago, a snakebite meant death. Indeed, the Pali texts record many monks dying this way (eg. [an4.67]). To compare a mendicant with a snake is to ascribe to them a potent power over life and death. Elsewhere, the Suttas warn us to beware of five things when they are young: a prince, a snake, a fire, a mendicant ([sn3.1]). Each of these may look harmless when small, but can be deadly when grown.

A snake often appears in a negative aspect: a taker of life, a loathsome spitter of poison, a shape-shifting master of deception. But the impression that the snake makes on the human mind is nothing if not complicated. We are afraid and fascinated in equal measure. One of the snake’s many mysterious properties is its ability to shed its skin. And in this we can see a manifestation of its deathly power not for destruction but for transformation.

The first verse offers a succinct summary of the entire Buddhist path, employing the snake metaphor in both dark and bright aspects.

>When anger surges, they drive it out,   
as with medicine a snake’s spreading venom.   
Such a mendicant sheds this world and the next,   
as a snake its old worn-out skin.

The first couplet reflects where we are: riven with anger. If anger is a poison, then there is on the one hand a threat to life; but on the other, there is a possibility of a cure. Now, the treatments available at that time—such as consuming disgusting substances like ash or dung as an emetic—were risky at best. But survival was not impossible, because the venom was “spreading”: it is an active, ongoing process, not something that is fated or destined. So if anger is likewise “spreading”, it too can be arrested.

Thus far the teaching aligns with what we might expect from a psychologist, or indeed, from common sense. But now the verse inverts the snake metaphor; the death threatened in the opening now manifests as something rather more mysterious: the shedding of skin, abandoning “this world and the next”. The Pali here is _orapāraṁ_, more literally, “the near shore and the far”. Often these terms refer to the mundane world of suffering and the transcendence of Nibbana, but here they must refer to “this world” in which one is born, and “another world” to which one goes after death, so I have translated accordingly. Verses commonly employ non-standard terms, whether for poetic expressiveness, or simply to fit the metre.

Whereas most psychology aims to alleviate extremes of distress and promote a healthy and balanced happiness, and most religion offers a promise of bliss in a future life, the Buddha promised something quite different. 

Taking the metaphor here on face value and without regard for context, one might come to two false conclusions. First, that such a transformation was for mendicants only. Yet while this text is addressed to mendicants, the Buddha made abundantly clear in many places that his path was for everyone. 

Second, that the essence of a person is hidden in their skin, and that the revelation of this true essence is the aim of Buddhist practice. In other words, one might argue that this text supports the theory that the Buddha’s teaching was essentially the same as that of the Upanishads. This is a popular view in modern times, although not one that Buddhists historically have held. 

If the Buddha wanted to teach of the survival of an abiding essence, he could have done a better job of it. Compare the following verse from Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.4.7.

>This corpse lies as lifeless as the slough of a snake shed in an anthill. But this incorporeal, immortal life-breath is sheer divinity, sheer incandescence.

The Upaniṣadic quote is a comment on a verse that speaks of releasing all the heart’s desires. The entire chapter is concerned with the passage of the “Self” from this world to the next world, and how this is propelled by a person’s deeds (_karma_). 

It is in this chapter that we find the first clear statement of the doctrine of _karma_ as moral deeds that is found anywhere (BrhUp 4.4.5). This idea is so central to Buddhism that it is tempting to believe it was a commonly accepted notion at the time. But it is not found clearly in the Vedas, and here it is introduced in an esoteric dialogue. The _karma_ theory is carefully qualified by noting that others have a different theory: the self is purely desire, and attains that which it wishes; it is the force of will that matters, not the moral quality of actions.

When you notice a detail in the Suttas that appears to echo something in the Upaniṣads, it often happens that it is not isolated; there are many ideas, phrases, and metaphors that connect the two. In these chapters, for example, we find the ancient way that is rediscovered (BrhUp 4.4.8); the aged body like a cart (BrhUp 4.3.35); the ability to see the effects of merit and demerit (BrhUp 4.3.15 ff., BrhUp 4.3.34); the comparison of the different heavenly realms (BrhUp 4.3.33); the functions of seeing, hearing, thinking, etc. (BrhUp 4.3.23 ff.); the method of negation (BrhUp 4.3.22), the attainment of a blissful unity free of desires (BrhUp 4.3.21); the image of freedom as detachment of a mango from its stalk (BrhUp 4.3.36); the unification of the senses (BrhUp 4.4.2); the recognition that limited knowledge is a form of ignorance leading to darkness (BrhUp 4.4.10); the phrasing of identification with the Self as “I am this” (BrhUp  4.4.12_ayamasmīti_); the idea that the ignorant suffer (BrhUp 4.4.14); the observation that thinking is fatiguing compared to awareness (BrhUp 4.4.21); giving up desire for children, renouncing the home and the worldy “quest” (_eṣana_), and wandering as a mendicant in search of truth (BrhUp 4.4.22); the identification of the state transcending rebirth as unborn, unaging, undying, and fearless (Bhu 4.4.25); which neither increases nor decreases (BrhUp 4.4.23); and the further identification of the Self as the creative divinity that is the cosmos (BrhUp 4.4.13: _sa viśvakṛt, sa hi sarvasya kartā, tasya lokaḥ, sa u loka eva_ ). The next chapter has even more, but I’ll stop there. 

Clearly these passages have a close affinity with the Suttas. There’s hardly a verse that doesn’t remind of the Suttas in some way. And the closeness is not just in content but in history as well. These chapters were spoken by the sage Yājñavalkya to King Janaka of Videha, perhaps a century or two before the Buddha. It is a curious thing that the Buddha, in his only recorded visit to Videha, spoke with and ultimately converted Brahmāyu, perhaps the oldest living brahmanical sage ([mn92]). Surely this text has a missionary purpose, to convert the most respected brahmin in this ancient home of some of the most famous brahmanical dialogues. Perhaps we are meant to wonder whether Brahmāyu was a student of Yājñavalkya. Regardless, there are many instances where the Buddha’s teaching clearly echoes and responds to that of Yājñavalkya, and we will encounter this again in the Suttanipāta, especially the final chapter.

Similarity, however, does not mean identity. If the Buddha was drawing on and echoing ideas from these dialogues, he did not do so uncritically; the differences are just as important as the similarities.

Yājñavalkya expresses his view with clarity and beauty: the Self is the person made of consciousness, the immortal light in the heart among the vital energies (BrhUp 4.3.7). There is no mistaking what he meant. The (very many) good folk who have tried to extract a similar view from the Suttas are reduced to seeking out in dusty allusions and twisted metaphors the same thing that Yājñavalkya was perfectly capable of stating directly.

Given this context, are we justified in concluding that the Snake Sutta was composed as a deliberate rejoinder to Yājñavalkya? It’s possible, but the connection is a little too vague to say definitively. And this is the case often in the Suttas: the Upaniṣadic view is there often, but not explicitly, so it is easy to overlook. Only when seeing the overall pattern does it become clear. To me, the emphasis on paradoxical phrasing and mysterious transcendence sounds a lot like an Upaniṣad. 

But I would make another proposal. The Suttanipāta as a whole ends with the Pārāyanavagga, a series of conversations with brahmins that closely evoke the Upaniṣads. I think the Snake Sutta was added at the beginning of the Suttanipāta to frame the entire collection as an implicit rejection of the Upaniṣadic doctrine. Right from the beginning, we hear an unequivocal rejection of any positive assertion of a Self, the core of Yājñavalkya’s teaching.

The Buddha adopts that which is of value in Yājñavalkya’s analysis: namely, that desire, hate, and ignorance create suffering and bind us to a cycle of rebirth. But when speaking of *shedding* the skin, he says nothing of a new or revealed state of the Self. It is the shedding itself that is the point. They find “no substance” in any existence, going beyond “any state of existence” because they know that it is all “not what it seems”. His response to the Upaniṣads is subtle and nuanced; what he does *not* say is as significant as what he does say.

### With Dhaniya the Cowherd

The second discourse, Dhaniyasutta (“With Dhaniya the Cowherd”, [snp1.2]) is of a very different nature. Here we leave aside calls to transcendence and subtle paradoxes for a dramatic dialogue between the Buddha and farmer. While the farmer speaks of his worldly safety and contentment, the Buddha betters him with his spiritual contentment. 

Unusually, the exchange is interrupted by a thunderstorm that rather conveniently illustrates the Buddha’s point. This, and the unexpected appearance of Māra near the end, give the impression that this poem has been furnished with dramatic flair. 

Within the Suttanipāta as a whole, it functions as a more playful and accessible entry point after the somewhat forbidding opening poem. In this, the form echoes a number of other collections, which similarly begin with an intimidating, difficult text, followed by a more practical and accessible one (eg. DN 1 and DN2, MN 1 and MN2).

### The Rhinoceros Horn

With the third discourse, the famous Khaggavisāṇasutta (“The Rhinoceros Horn”, ([snp1.3]) we have another change in mood. Here we find neither philosophical paradoxes nor dramatic dialogue, but a heartfelt and pragmatic plea for the solitary life of a wandering ascetic. This poem received a commentary in the canonical Niddesa, alongside the final two chapters. All three texts, it seems, were independently well-known before their inclusion in the Suttanipāta. They are, however, far from the only texts that have a canonical commentary. For example, most of the central doctrinal passages have a commentary in the Abhidhamma; the _pāṭimokkha_, in the Vinaya Vibhaṅga. Indeed, many Suttas can be considered as commentaries on teachings propounded elsewhere. We could even go so far as to say that all the Suttas are commentary on the first sermon, drawing out the implications of the four noble truths.

What makes the Khaggavisāṇasutta special is not the fact of its commentary, but its endorsement of the solitary life. Again, the significance of this is often overstated. There’s nothing in the Sutta that ties it to a specially early period of Buddhism, or which justifies thinking of it as representing a period of Buddhism before institutionalized monasticism. On the contrary: why would anyone give a teaching on solitariness if that’s how everyone lived already? A teacher looks to the balance and tendencies within a community and encourages what they need, not what they already have. This teaching only makes sense as a reaction to increasing settledness and institutionalization. Monastic life, to this day, has a tension between a life of institutionalized security and one of wandering freedom. This is part of the core dynamic of our communities. It cannot be resolved by a decree; all mendicants feel the call of the solitary life. To live alone, aloof from the dramas and desires of worldly society, the open road and the creatures and the trees your only companions; who has not felt the yearning for such a life?

The poem strikes an uncompromising tone, a principled rejection of worldly attachments, regardless of the pain, and an equally unsentimental acknowledgement of the tribulations of a solitary life in the forest. In this, it lies perhaps closer to the Jains than to the brahmins; thus the three opening Suttas can be read as responses to brahmanical philosophy, enjoyment of the lay life, and asceticism respectively.

The imagery is tough and masculine, rejecting affection, independent like a lion, suspicious of others’ motives; not to mention the imagery of the rhino horn. A rare exception allows that one may wander together with a good friend, and alone if no good friend is found. But these two verses are found elsewhere ([xxx]) and are the only two lacking the “rhino horn” in the last line, so it seems clear they were added to the text. They are, however, followed by another verse that expresses a similar idea, so there is a sliver of compromise. An overly harsh attitude to seclusion can lead to a certain hard-heartedness, so the poem does not neglect to mention the development of love and compassion. Indeed, when the Sutta is quoted in the Apadāna, there is an extra “lost verse” right at the start, which begins the whole discourse speaking of love and compassion ([tha-ap2:9.3]). It gives rather a different framing to the poem.

### With Bhāradvāja the Farmer

With the fourth Sutta, we see a return to a brahmanical context, but this time in a more conventional way. The Kasibhāradvājasutta (“With Bhāradvāja the Farmer” [snp1.4]), which is found also in the Saṁyutta ([sn7.1]) with a shorter narrative portion, tells us of a brahmin who works as a farmer. To celebrate the sowing season, he distributes food for anyone who comes. 

It’s worth noting that the name Bhāradvāja is used in the Suttas as a conventional appellation for a (usually snooty) brahmin, and it is regularly prepended with a nickname which is simply the thing discussed in the Sutta. Here _kasi_ means simply “farming”. Below we shall meet the Bhāradvāja _aggika_, which means “fire-worshipper”. These are more like descriptive epithets than personal names.

Hymns for farming are found as far back as the old Vedic tradition, many centuries before the Upaniṣads. The Vedic hymns focus on the celebration of abundance and prosperity in life, and that includes agriculture. Early Vedic hymns include invocations to the “Lord of the Field” to bless the ploughing and the crops (Rig Veda 4.57.4). These invocations did not remain merely as dead letters, for they are cited in much later ritual texts, which say that a brahmin should recite them when touching the plough (Saṅkhāyana Grihya Sūtra 4.13). Such verses, and others (eg. Rig Veda 10.101.3), invoke the different parts of the ploughing—goad, plough, seed, furrow—in a way not dissimilar to the Kasibhāradvājasutta. Atharvaveda 6.142.3 says that the “givers” of the grain shall be inexhaustible, perhaps suggesting a food distribution practice.

To pour seed on the ground is an act of faith: the belief that, gods willing, the seed will grow and supply food the next year. By distributing food—the fruits of last year’s sowing—the brahmin is mirroring the act of sowing itself, and thus amplifying its fruitfulness. That this is not an entirely selfless act becomes apparent when he sees the Buddha, and tells him he can only eat if he farms. His distrust of ascetics hails from the more worldly traditions of the Vedas, rather than the mystical path of renunciate sages like Yājñavalkya. 

Drawing on similar rhetorical tactics that he used in the Dhaniyasutta, the Buddha ascribes a spiritual meaning to each of the items of the farmer. This kind of point-by-point spiritual metaphor is a characteristic of the Upaniṣads, especially in those portions that ascribe a hidden meaning to each aspect of the ritual and the rites. That this is central to the Upaniṣadic project is shown by the fact that the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad opens with such a set of correspondences (_sandhi_). 

>The head of the sacrificial horse is the dawn; its eye is the sun; its vital breath is the wind …

And so it goes. It was in this way that the Upaniṣadic philosophers were able to break new ground, extending and deepening their philosophy, while still maintaining that they were continuing the same tradition. Hence the leitmotif of the Upaniṣads: _ya evam veda_ “one who knows this …”. Each act, each detail, has a higher meaning, which a true brahmin understands. The Buddha is using exactly the same technique to convince the brahmin that there is a higher meaning behind his traditional duties. 

In a curious twist, the brahmin offers his milk-rice to the Buddha “whose farming has the deathless as its fruit”. The Buddha rejects his offering—a very rare circumstance, as mendicants are normally required to accept any offering with gratitude and humility. The poem says this food has been “enchanted by a spell”, and indeed, when it is discarded it sizzles and fumes in the water. The implications of this episode are complex, but I’ll try to unpack a few aspects of it. 

Dietary laws were, and are, fundamental to the notion of caste in India. The brahmins—in theory—took only the purest food and did not share a plate with others. This was in direct contrast with the practice of ascetics such as the Buddha, who accepted food from anyone without discrimination.

The brahmin has performed a ritual by chanting. That this is literally an “enchantment” rather than simply “chanting over” is shown by the fact that the food has acquired a mysterious magical property. The brahmin caste represents the divinity Brahmā on earth, from whom all power and creative force derive. In their belief system, they are a manifestation of divine energy, and through their chanting they channel that energy into the material realm. Thus the milk-rice is infused with a potency, which, like all power, is dangerous in the wrong hands. The Buddha can consume it, since his power supersedes that of Brahmā. Yet he chooses not to. The text is silent as to why. But we can speculate that the magical act of consuming such potent food would, in the eyes of the brahmins, mark the Buddha as an acolyte of Brahmā himself, else how could he survive it? By rejecting the ritually potent food, the Buddha is affirming his independence from the Brahmanical system. For him, food is simply a material means of sustenance.

### With Cunda the Smith

Next there follows the Cundasutta, which the Buddha apparently taught near the end of his life to the smith Cunda ([snp1.5]). It is omitted from the account of the meeting between Cunda and the Buddha in the Pali Mahāparinibbānasutta, but it is found in the Sanskrit versions of that text. Both the Sanskrit text and the Pali commentary give the same origin: a monk steals golden dish on which Cunda had served the meal. 

Cunda asks the Buddha to define the different kinds of ascetic (_samaṇa_) in the world. The Buddha gives three examples of good ascetics, and one of bad. He encourages lay disciples to use discernment and not equate one with the other.

### Downfalls

Continuing the theme of practical advice for lay folk, we next find the first of the great popular Suttas of the Suttanipāta, the Parābhavasutta ([snp1.6]). This gives an extensive list of moral failings into which lay folk might fall, framed within the question of a deity in the manner of the Sagāthāvagga. It’s a perennially popular discourse for recitation and sermons. 

The ethics are not specifically Buddhist, but would have been broadly acceptable to anyone in the Buddha‘s culture, and for the most part, remain so today. It is notable, however, that the actor whose morality is discussed is assumed to be a straight male,  hence I have translated using the masculine gender.

### The Lowlife

In the Vasalasutta (“The Lowlife, [snp1.7]) we meet another Bhāradvāja, this time an orthodox fire-worshipping brahmin. The worship of fire is one of the oldest, if not the oldest, rites of humanity, and it was a part of the ancestral Indo-Aryan religion. There is an inherenmt tension between the performance of religious rituals and the principles of morality: if doing the ritual is trul effective, then why keep moral rules?

Like the other Bhāradvāja we have already met, this gentleman is no great fan of ascetics. When he sees the Buddha, he doesn’t just not offer him anything, but yells abuse, calling him a “shaveling, fake ascetic, lowlife”. Being met with abuse and ridicule in the village is a part of the mendicant’s life, although one which is more often mentioned in the Jain texts; the fact that they were naked and never bathed might havce something to do with it. Typically, Buddhist mendicants both past and present encounter a warm and respectful welcome when on alms round, and abuse is very much the exception.

The Sutta details a series of moral failings in a way not dissimilar to the previous. The Buddha, respending to the personal attack on him, turns it around, claiming that one who abuses ascetics or reviles the Buddha is the real lowlife. He argues that deeds, not birth, make you a lowlife or a brahmin, implying that the brahmin himself is no brahmin but an outcaste. He further tells a story of an outcaste who lived a life of such virtue that he became a Brahmā divinity himself, implying that the brahmin had all this time been worshipping an outcaste. 

The Buddha points out that it is precisely those brahmins who are most often seen reciting hymns and performing pious deeds who turn out to be deeply involved in corrupt deeds. This remains as relevant to Buddhism now as it was to Brahmanism then.

### The Discourse on Love

Shifting to a positive mood, we next find the famous Mettasutta (“The Discourse on Love” [snp1.8]). Rather than a series of verses on a theme, this is a coherent poem divided roughly into three sections: verses 1–3ab lay the foundation for virtuous conduct; 4cd–6 describe the meditation on love; while verses 7–9 depict the exultant state of liberation that results. Verse 10 is in a different metre and appears to be a later addition, alluding to the development of insight for attaining first stream-entry, then non-return.

I now translate _mettā_ as “love” rather than the Buddhist neologism “loving-kindness”. The latter has become widely accepted, and is justified by arguing that “love” has too much of a sensual connotation. Pali distinguishes sensual from spiritual love, much like the Latin *eros* and *agape*. I once asked an elderly Catholic contemplative monk about this. His native language was Italian, and he said there is no equivalent distinction in modern Italian; they just use *amore* in both cases, and let the context make the meaning clear. I suspect that the real reason for the popularity of “loving-kindness” is that modern Buddhists are often uncomfortable around expressing emotions. “Loving-kindness” is a more distancing word, it’s emotionally cooler than “love”. As always, I prefer the more direct, ordinary language expression.

### The Buddha Teaches Sātāgira and Hemavata the Native Spirits

The next sutta finds two _yakkhas_ (“native spirits”) having a perhaps unlikely conversation about the Buddha’s spiritual qualities as they debate whether to visit him on the _uposatha_ (“Sabbath”), and proceed to ask a series of questions ([snp1.9]). The questions are of a vaguely riddling form—“In what has the world arisen?”—and seem to presuppose a serious interest in Buddhism, or at least, in the kinds of problems discussed among ancient Indian ascetics.

There’s nothing in the content itself, however, that suggests the speakers were _yakkhas_. Most of the verses are found elsewhere in the Saṁyuttanikāya, and it is likely that the current Sutta is a compilation.

The _yakkhas_ of the Suttas, while having aggressive tendencies, are on the whole morally neutral. They are usually the spirits of particular places, embodiements of the forces of nature. They rarely display such an elevated sense of morality as here. Their names are Sātāgira and Hemavata, which reveal them to be titulary deities of the mountainous regions. They end by promising to travel far and wide spreading the good news of the Dhamma. This suggests that the verses acted as a missionary text for the Himalayan region, into which Buddhism was spreading in the century after the Buddha’s death.

### Āḷavaka the Native Spirit

The ferocious side of the _yakkhas_ is expressed by the monstrous Āḷavaka who appears next ([snp1.10]). His story became a famous one in Theravada, and the Chinese sources also include an extensive backstory. ???

He comes out full of bully and bluster in the prose narrative, but the verses settle down to a conventional exchange of Dhamma questions. 

Āḷavaka, like Sātāgira and Hemavata, is a titular deity who announced his zeal for spreading the Dhamma, but his town Āḷavī was less remote, lying between Sāvatthī and Rājagaha. 

### Victory

Though separated by two Suttas, the Vijayasutta (“Victory”, [snp1.11]) might be considered as a pair with the Mettasutta, as the former teaches the meditation on love that overcomes hate, while this teaches the meditation on the parts of the body that overcomes desire (verse 11, _kāye chandaṁ virājaye_). This meditation is found commonly in the Suttas, and here is expressed in poetic form.

### The Sage

The final Sutta of the chapter, the Munisutta (“The Sage”, [snp1.12]) exalts the solitary life of the renunciate. The imagery of the steadfast sage aloof from worldly impulses brings us full circle with the Uragasutta and the Khaggavisāṇasutta. 

In contrast with the Kasibhāradvājasutta, rather than co-opting the imagery of agricultural flourishing, here the Buddha defiantly opposes it, speaking of ending new growth. The metaphors draw upon a specific set of ideas found more explicitly in prose suttas such as [sn22.54].

## The Lesser Chapter

The second chapter is similar in themes and poetic forms to the first, but it seems to lack even the loose plan found there. 

### Gems

In between two sets of benedective verses, the Ratanasutta offers a subtle and insightful survey of the famed Triple Gem—the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha. Note that here, as elsewhere in the Suttas, these are not actually called “Gems”. Rather, the “gems” are good qualities that are found in them, much like the gemstones found in the great ocean ([an8.19:8.1]). But it seems likely that the idea of the “Triple Gem” evolved from this Sutta.

Each verse ends in a tag line. But usually such tags will make a statement of fact: “this is a cause of downfall” or “this is the highest blessing”. Here, however, the tag line is a “blessing” in imperative form—“may there be well-being” or more colloquially, “may you be well”. This wish (_sotthi hotu_) is elsewhere found in a more everyday sense, as a simple plea for safety ([dn3:1.23.11]). The sense here, with the implication that the power of truthful words will have a powerful effect in themselves, finds its only early parallel in the Aṅgulimālasutta.  There, powerful words of truth wishing well for a mother in travail resulted in a successful birth and healthy mother and child ([mn86:15.8]). 

Such texts skirt a fine line. They don’t exactly say that the words of Dhamma exert a magical force, but they don’t exactly not say that either. It’s possible to read them as words of encouragement and uplift, whose effects are purely motivational. But that is surely not how generations of Buddhists have taken them.

The doctrinal content of the Ratanasutta leans heavily on concepts and ideas developed in the prose Suttas, and much of it would be incomprehensible on its own. A stream-enterer, for example, is said to “not take up an eighth life”, which draws on the notion that a stream-enterer, having uprooted certain fundamental fetters, is reborn no more than seven times.

A more subtle example is the “immersion with immediate fruit” spoke of in verse five, said to be the unequalled state of meditation. This is not a common technical term in the Suttas. The key term is “immediate” (_ānantarika_). This only occurs in one other Sutta, which is one of the latest in the canon, and there it is only said that such a state is hard to comprehend ([dn34:1.2.21]).

_Ānantarika_ is closely aligned with a spectrum of more familiar terms—_akālika_, _sandiṭṭhika_, _diṭṭheva dhamme_—all of which convey the sense that the Dhamma is to be realized “in this very life”, as opposed to a religious practice that only bears fruit in a future life (_samparāyika_). Thus the “immersion of immediate result” is the practice of _jhāna_ within the context of the eightfold path, which results in the realization of the noble fruits. Compare the case of the Buddha’s former teachers, whose path resulted a state of rebirth in a refined and long-lasting heavenly realm, which was nonetheless still impermanent and not free from suffering. Both traditiions practice deep _samādhi_, but only when informed by the right view of the four noble truths will that _samādhi_ lead to awakening.

The presence of benedictive verses at the beginning and end; the framing of each verse as a blessing; and the prominence of advanced doctrinal content all make it tempting to think that the Ratanasutta must stem from a slightly later phase within the early texts. If that is true, however, it can’t be very late, for the Ratanasutta has a close parallel in the Mahāvastu of the Mahāsaṅghika school. Given that the Mahāsaṅghika and the Theravāda split in the first schism, perhaps two centuries after the Buddha, it’s likely that the compostion predates this. And this in turn gives us a framework for assessing the likely date of similarly late-seeming compositions. With few exceptions, they appear to have been composed or compiled in the same period.

### Putrescence

The Āmagandhasutta (“Putrescence”, [snp2.2]) is one of the few early discourses to directly discuss vegetarianism. An unnamed interlocuter claims that pure folk only eat vegetables, not lying to get what they want. The list of foods appears to be purely wild vegetables and grains, so he appears to be advocating a diet of vegan food gathered from nature. This was a traditional ascetic practice found among certain circles. In the Jātaka stories we hear many times of brahmin renunciates who retreated to the Himalayas to live on such a diet, which was regarded as a special mark of ascetic prowess (eg. [ja536]). The speaker, it would seem, is familiar with such ascetics. He criticizes “Kassapa” for eating delicious food cooked by others. And he calls out Kassapa’s hypocrisy in claiming that “putrescence is not proper for me”, yet all the while he is eating rice with the flesh of fowl. This seems to be the basis on which he hints Kassapa has lied to get good food.

The word translated as “putrescence” is _āmagandha_, literally “raw smell”. It’s the smell of a rotting corpse, and doesn’t have any intrinsic connection to meat-eating. Rather, it appears throughout the Suttas in the sense of “moral decay or corruption” ([an3.128:2.2]). According to the Mahāgovindasutta, it was Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra himself who taught that the real meaning of “putrescence” was the defilements such as anger ([dn19:46.15]). Thus Kassapa in the Āmagandhasutta, who is identified as a “kinsman of Brahmā”, is advocating the same position as Brahmā himself. But only the Āmagandhasutta connects the notions of “putrescence” and eating meat.

Before proceeding, let’s briefly review the position of the early texts on meat. It is accepted as normal throughout the Suttas and Vinaya that the Buddha and his community ate meat if they wished. Nonetheless, when the topic comes up it is usually hedged with cautions and restrictions. 

In the Jīvakasutta, the layman Jīvaka reports the rumor that the Buddha eats meat specially killed for him ([mn55]). The Buddha denies doing so, and repeats the well known Vinaya allowance that meat or fish may be eaten by a mendicant unless it is seen, heard, or suspected to have been killed on purpose for the mendicant. Normally a mendicant will simply accept whatever is placed in the bowl, and since they wander at random through a village, no-one is preparing food for them specially. The bulk of the Sutta shifts focus to the elevated practice of the four divine abidings and restraint by the mendicants, and analyzes in detail the ethical boundaries that are crossed by someone who kills an animal to offer the mendicants. From the moment they order the beast to be fetched for killing, they make bad kamma. Thus the emphasis of the Sutta as a whole is not to justify meat-eating but to establish the strict criteria under which meat-eating is permitted, and to graphically illustrate the evil of killing for food.

In the Vinaya itself, the threefold allowance is not the only word on meat-eating. A mendicant is forbidden from eating ten kinds of meat—human, elephant, horse, dog, snake, lion, tiger, leopard, bear, and hyena ([pli-tv-kd6:23.1.1] ff.). And given that it is not always obvious whether such meat is being served, it is an offence to eat any meat without first having checked that it is allowable ([pli-tv-kd6:23.9.9]). It’s also an offence to accept raw meat ([dn1:1.10.9]). Meat is regarded as one of the luxurious foods ([dn26:19.6]), asking for which is forbidden ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc39:2.10.1]). Certain ascetics, including Jains, refused all meat ([dn25:8.5]), but the Buddha resisted their pressure to follow suit, since their argument was in bad faith; it was based on the false accusation that he ate food slaughtered for him ([an8.12:31.4]). He likewise rejected Devadatta’s proposal that all mendicants must be vegetarian, along with a range of other ascetic practices, as it too was merely a pretense to attack the Buddha. Instead, he left the decision with individual mendicants ([pli-tv-kd17:3.14.13]). Other ascetics went to the opposite extreme, consuming only meat and alcohol, apparently blazing the trail for certain delusional teachers today ([dn24:1.11.4]). While the position of brahmins on meat is ambiguous, there is at least one passage where a brahmin laments his meat-eating as being unrighteous ([pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69:1.32]).

Thus the general position of the Suttas on meat-eating for mendicants is to restrict its usage and leave the final decision up to the individual. As for the lay folk, there are no special pronouncements as such. But it is considered wrong livelihood to trade in animals or in meat ([an5.177]). And of course it is wrong to kill or harm an animal under any circumstances, or to have one killed. Again, there is restriction without prohibition.

In this discussion, I have left the identity of “Kassapa” aside. It is a common name for brahmins. The Sutta is concluded with two verses which, according to the commentary, were added by the redactors at the Council. It’s an unusual ending, which suggests that a pre-existing set of verses was adapted for the context. Now, in these closing verses “Kassapa” is identified as a Buddha, who must be the legendary Buddha of the past of that name. Obviously such a legendary attribution cannot be taken literally, but rather is another sign of an imported text. Further, the main series of verses, which end with the tag line “this is putrescence, not eating meat”, deal only with general ethical matters and don’t have any distinctively Buddhist teachings. The last two verses of the teaching (before the closing verses) lack this ending tag. They say nothing of “putrescence”, but contain a Buddhist criticism of Brahmanical ideas of ritual purification. 

So the Suttas attribute the teaching on “putrescence” as moral decay to Brahmā. And the relevant portions of the Āmagandhasutta are purely a discussion between two brahmins, with all the Buddhist content added later. It seems to me, then, that the main teaching here is a Brahmanical dialogue that was adopted as a Buddhist text by adding some framing verses and a background story. Perhaps this explains why, while the position on meat-eating here does not technically contradict that found in the rest of the canon, it does have a more pushy vibe, lacking the tendency towards constraints that we find elsewhere. 

The puzzling thing in all this is the question of supply and demand. Economic theory tells us that demand for a certain good drives its production. If people buy more meat, suppliers will kill more animals. But the Suttas don’t think in terms of a generalized concept of economic demand for meat, only a personal and individual one. To us, this seems like such a natural and obvious argument, yet even the Buddha’s critics don’t make it. Why is that?

In pre-industrial societies, the supply of meat is relatively fixed. Chickens run around the yard, cows graze in a field, fish swim in a stream. A certain number of animals are killed for their flesh, but well-functioning societies do not over-cull and deplete their supply. But too many animals is also a problem, as they eat the crops. Typically, larger animals are killed for celebrations or special days, or when the supply becomes excessive and must be burned off. This is ritualized in the form of the sacrifice. In addition, there are no simple means to store large quantities of meat long-term, so animals are usually slaughtered and eaten right away. 

Thus the early texts employ the concept of “available meat” (_pavattamaṁsa_): it was either there or it wasn’t. The animals would be killed regardless, which is why it only becomes an ethical issue for the mendicants when animals are killed on purpose for them. There’s a good illustration of this in the Vinaya ([pli-tv-kd6:23.2.8]). The laywoman Suppiyā tried to order some meat, but there was none for sale in the city of Benares, since no slaughtering had been done that day. No meat in the entire city: unthinkable to us, but normal to them. 

There was no concept of increasing the supply of meat to cater for demand, because the material means of increasing supply simply did not exist. It is only in recent centuries, with the application of scientific and industrial techniques to animal husbandry, that we have learned to expand the supply of meat at will. Producing more meat takes energy, and that energy is supplied by fossil fuels. 

Arguably, the concept of “available meat” no longer applies, except in limited cases such as roadkill. All meat is produced on demand, even if that demand is indirect. When monastics accept meat, this acts as an implicit endorsement for the lay community, so that even those who were formerly vegetarian start eating meat. This contributes to expanding demand for meat in society as a whole.

This demand drives the machinery of death in the slaughterhouses, the grotesque horrors of the factory farms, the grim scouring of the oceans, and the ecocidal madness of climate collapse. Those who eat meat belong to the most privileged generation that has ever lived on this planet, blessed with an astonishing quantity and variety of delicious foods, yet they choose to demand the flesh of living creatures. It is certainly possible to argue that this is “allowed” in the ancient texts. But the economic, material, and social context has completely changed. Is this really the best we can do—to take what we want because we can get away with it?

### Conscience

The Hirisutta is named after its first word, but the theme is, rather, good friendship ([snp2.3]). Even though the poem has only five verses, it appears somewhat disjointed, as the final two verses seem disconnected from the first three. Perhaps it is simply a somewhat clumsy compilation. But I suspect the whole is more coherent than it appears.

The poem begins with a description of a bad friend, who betrays you or looks for flaws. It especially emphasizes that a good friend is one who acts for one’s benefit, not just talking. The third verse ends with a moving and intimate image: a true friend rests with you like a child lying on the breast.

It is the fourth verse that seems to break the pattern. The syntax is tricky, but I think the key is the word _porisa_. One is said to carry the “_porisa_” burden. This is explained in the commentary here as being “fit for a person (_purisa_)”. _Porisa_ is also used in the sense of a “servant”. I think the sense here is that one serves others by acting as a good friend for them. In doing such service—the virtues spoken of in the first three verses—one can expect a worldly happiness and praise. 

The final verse then brings in the twist: the benefits of even such virtuous and loving companionship pale in comparison to the blissful nectar of seclusion. It raises the virtue from the mundane to the transcendant, as do so many Dhamma verses.

### Blessings

The Maṅgalasutta redefines the superstitious notion of an “auspicous sign” (_maṅgala_) in practical and ethical terms (Maṅgalasutta, [snp2.4]). The prose background serves to authorize the new definition in the eyes of the gods, who, one might have suspected, knew what an auspcious sign really was. _Maṅgala_ shades in meaning from a prohetic aurgury (“auspice”) to a more general sense of “felicity” or “good fortune”.

People still seek to know the future by reading tea leaves or checking their horoscope. Such practices are an extremely widespread human phenomenon, not limited to one particular culture or religion. The Suttas mention countless such practices and dismiss them all. One who has seen the truth will not believe in such things ([an6.93]), but the Buddha was not harsh about this, as he did allow mendicants to step on a cloth as a _maṅgala_ as a concession to the superstitions of layfolk ([pli-tv-kd15:21.4.11]), even though he would not do so himself ([mn85:7.16]).

The “blessings” in the Maṅgalasutta are things that are both good in and of themselves, and which lead to a good outcome in the future. The sense of creating an auspicious future through auspicious deeds comes out more clearly in [an3.155], where a lucky star (_sunakkhatta_) and a good auspice (_sumaṅgala_) lead to happy results. In the Maṅgalasutta this is implicit in the sturcture of the text, which moves from the simple building-blocks of a good life to the sublime bliss of freedom.

It is in its recognition of the simple things that the Maṅgalasutta distinguishes itself. There are many Suttas that eulogize the virtues of renunciation, but few that speak of getting an education in a craft or skill, or which recognize the crucial importance of living in a region hospitable for practice.

The very first line of the Buddha’s response has a special significance for me. When I first read it, devouring all the Suttas as a newly-enthused meditator, it struck a discordant note. “Not to associate with fools”—isn’t that mean? And who gets to say who is a fool? Today, however, I think this is a crucial statement, and its placement at the start of a text that lays the foundation for a blessed life is no accident. If we become caught up in the words of fools—those who preach anger and division, who spin delusional conspiracies in the name of truth—then our minds become twisted, and any possibility of moral or spiritual progress is lost. All the more valuable are the compassionate and reasonable words of the Buddha.

### With Spiky, the Native Spirit

Unlike the _yakkhas_ we met previously, here Kharo (“Shaggy”) and Sūciloma (“Spiky”) are named not after places, but after their rather unkempt and intimidating coverings ([snp2.5]). But as with Āḷavaka, once the unpleasantries of the introduction were over, the questions are not merely civil, but positively sophisticated: “where do the mind’s thoughts originate, like a crow let loose by boys?”

The Buddha’s response is insightful and challenging. But at the end there is no word as to the _yakkhas_’ response, unlike the spirits of place who committed themselves to spreading the Dhamma in their region. The prose introduction, however, allows for a different kind of symbolic reading.

In the Hemavatasutta, the _yakkhas_ are discussing the observance of a sabbath day, and propose to see the Buddha. So this discourse can be read as a conversion narrative, where the Buddhist observance displaces an earlier animist observance in the mountainous regions. In the Āḷavakasutta, it is the Buddha who is intruding in Āḷavaka’s home at Āḷavī, just as Buddhism came into places that already had animist forms of worship. While there was initial discomfort, soon enough Āḷavaka was happy with the intrusion. 

The Sūcilomasutta, on the other hand, is set in the very heartland of Buddhism, at Gayā, close by the seat of the Buddha’s enlightenment. The Buddha is still sitting in the haunt of the _yakkha_—because even there, animism predates the Buddha—but it is the _yakkhas_ who pass close by the Buddha. They press up against him, just as the ancient animist practices pressed up against Buddhism even in its heartland; it was a prickly situation. The Buddhists saw the _yakkhas_—and by extension their worshippers—as coarse, verging on violent, and saw themselves as a civilizing and uplifting influence. They didn’t dismiss others because of their different practices, but saw in them a potential for growth.

### A Righteous Life

Like the Hirisutta, the Dhammacariyasutta is named after the first word. But it’s a bit misleading, because the bulk of the Sutta is about unrighteous conduct, and only the beginning and the end return to good conduct. The commentarial title Kapilasutta is spurious, as there is no mention of a Kapila in the text. 

The mission statement of this text is in the first two verses: if someone goes forth as a mendicant but is of bad character and conduct, things only get worse for them. Monastic life is no magical cure for depravity. And indeed, for one who presents themselves to the world as a paragon of virtue, the consequences of bad behavior are even worse.

The poem denounces those of bad conduct and urges the Saṅgha to expell wicked mendicants, as the Buddha did also at [an8.10] and [an8.20]. There are several legal mechanisms in the Vinaya for such matters. 

One interesting detail worth noting: the Buddha does not do the expulsion himself. He built the Saṅgha to take responsibility for its own actions. And just as it is up to the Saṅgha to decide who to accept in their ranks, it is up to them to decide who to expel. 

## Brahmanical Traditions

Asked by some senior brahmins about the ancient brahmanical ways, the Buddha laments that brahmins have fallen far from their pure ancient traditions ([snp2.7]). The nadir was the ritual slaughter of cows, a vile practice that was specifically called for by the brahmins themselves, against the outraged cries of the gods. 

The Buddha depicts the ancioent brahmins as having been renunciant seers devoted to austerity and meditation. This generally accords with the description in the Aggaññasutta ([dn27:22.6]), although not every detail is the same. There, they are said to have gone to the village for alms, whereas here food was left outside their doors; there, taking up recitation was felt to be a decline from meditation, whereas here their dovotion to chanting is praised. Nonetheless, overall the tenor is that the brahmins lived then much like the bhikkhus do today.

While the depoiction of ancient brahmanical life is largely consistent within the Buddhist texts, it is hard to know how it relates to actual brahmanical practices as depicted in their own texts. The oldest brahmanical text, the Rig Veda, glorifies the gods for the sake of worldly prosperity. Clearly, an ascetic tradition emerged within brahmanism at some point, and is referred to in the Upaniṣads, but it seems a stretch to argue that this was the normal and accepted practice among brahmins. 

The text refers to a period of 48 years of “virginal spiritual life”; in other words, brahmins married at 48 and remained celibate until then. The practice of _brahmacarya_ is referred to only once in a late Rig Vedic verse (RV 10,109.05); and the system of four stages of life (_āśrama_) with _brahmacarya_ as the first only appears in later texts. When they did marry, it was out of love, not arranged, and sex was restricted to the fertile portion of the wife’s cycle.

The text is full of fascinating details, and while the overarching message is clear, it is not easy to say how to read it. Does it record genuine traditions among brahmins, some of which are lost to us—as it seems they were even lost to brahmins of the Buddha’s day? Or is it purely a Buddhist fable, designed to exalt the mendicant lifestyle? 

There are a couple of statements in the text that, if one reads with the commentary, appear to support the caste doctrine, and would thus support the former reading. The ancient brahmins are praised for only marrying within their caste ([snp2.7:8.1]), and a cause of their decline was the rejection of the doctrine of caste ([snp2.7:33.4]). However a closer reading shows that neither of these phrases is quite so clear. The first literally just says theat the “did not go to another”, which could be a reference to infidelity. And as to the second, _jātivāda_ in the Suttas doesn’t quite mean “doctrine of caste”. 

Rig Veda 1.164.40 (Wilson translation)
sūyavasād bhagavatī hi bhūyā atho vayam bhagavantaḥ syāma | addhi tṛṇam aghnye viśvadānīm piba śuddham udakam ācarantī
>Cow, may you be rich in milk through abundant fodder; that we also may be rich (in abundance); eat grass at all seasons, and, roaming (at will), drink pure water.
