The Therīgāthā or “Verses of the Senior Nuns” is the ninth book in the Khuddhaka Nikāya of the Pali Canon or Tipiṭaka. It is a collection of about 524 verses attributed to 73 senior nuns, most of whom were alive in the Buddha’s time. 

These verses celebrate the bliss of freedom and the life of meditation, full of proud and joyous proclamations of their spiritual attainments and their gratitude to other nuns as guides and teachers. The Therīgāthā is one of the oldest spiritual texts that records primarily women’s voices. It stems from the same general period as the Hebraic Books of Ruth and Esther, and like those books, it is a natural touchstone for those who wish to reflect on women’s roles in ancient religion.

It is a pair with the Theragāthā, the “Verses of the Senior Monks”. Together these collections constitute one of the oldest and largest records of the voices of contemplatives. Based on style and content, these collections belong to the early discourses, although occasionally the verses seem to be a little later. They are referred to on occasion in the northern canons, but no parallel collections have survived. 

In my introduction to the Theragāthā I gave a general background. Most of those remarks apply equally here, so in this essay I will focus on those things that are specific to the Therīgāthā and refer you to the Theragāthā for the basics.

## The Therīgāthā as a Feminist Text

The Therīgāthā is feminist in the sense of foregrounding women’s voices and experiences, and on occasion pointing to the specific ways that suffering of women is due to gendered discrimination. At the same time, though, it’s critical to remember that these are the voices of women in a very different time and place, and they do not exist to serve our agendas. There’s nothing feminist about eliding, paraphrasing, or interpreting away the voices of women because they’re not saying what we would want them to say. 



In a review of Susan Murcott’s translation <cite>The First Buddhist Women</cite>, George-Thérèse Dickenson (Tricycle, summer 1992) doubts the spiritual attainments claimed by the women of the Therīgāthā. The bhikkhunī Khemā is harassed by a young man who tries to get her to go and see a band together ([thig6.3]). She objects, pointing out that her body is “rotting, ailing, and frail” and saying that she is “repelled” by it and has given up sensual desires. The young man, of course, is none other than Māra the “terminator” (_antakāra_), who is summarily vanquished by Khemā’s awesomeness. 

Dickenson’s response is to question whether Khemā can really be completely freed from suffering if she is saying such things. Now, to someone familiar with Buddhist teachings these things are fairly standard. When someone is in the grip of lust, they focus on the beautiful, so the antidote is to see the other side, the rather undeniable fact that bodies are pretty icky. Yes, the language is strong; but then, so is desire. Ignoring the Buddhist context, Dickenson’s go-to move is to suggest that Khemā doesn’t know what she’s talking about, that she is in denial as to the fundamental tenets of her own religion and the results of her own practice. 

If I didn’t know better, I might say that Dickenson, being herself in the thrall of sensuality, is unable to understand those who are freed, and instead chooses to judge other women instead of aspiring to something higher. But I do know better, and I am not in the business of second-guessing the motivations of others and assuming the worst when it comes to their intentions.

She goes on to undermine Subha’s claims to be beyond passion, arguing that the text describes the fullness and beauty of nature. It’s a weird argument, which again points to a lack of understanding of basic Buddhism. It’s quite possible to appreciate nature without wanting to have sex with it. More to the point, the words cited are ascribed by the text to the young man who accosts Subha. Dickenson misunderstands these as the words of Subha quoting the young man, whereas they are in fact his words as cited by an unknown narrator. Regardless, Dickenson is questioning whether Subha can report the words of a man talking sensually without herself feeling desire. It should, I hope, be obvious that it is perfectly normal to quote or refer to things without endorsing them.

Based on this mangling of both the text and the tenets of Buddhism, Dickenson asserts:

>These are instances in which the poem is asserting itself despite the intention of the poet. It is language coming to fullness, actualizing itself behind the speaker’s back.

Which is a fancy way of saying that those nuns were deluded, that they understood neither their own minds nor the spiritual path in which they were practicing, and it took the insight of a 20th century American to set them right. To offer an alternate perspective: perhaps those women knew exactly what they were doing, and said exactly what they meant. It just doesn’t dovetail with the reviewer’s ideological presuppositions.

Academic studies of the Therīgāthā highlight its complex and apparently contradictory attitudes towards women and the female body, which reflect those in the wider Buddhist tradition. Which is an important insight, because in every other culture in the world, ideas around gender and femininity are straightforward and uncontested. Oh wait.
