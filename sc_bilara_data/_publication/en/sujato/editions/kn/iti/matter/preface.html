<h1>Preface</h1>
<p>We should always respect our teachers, and I want to take this time to remember one of my most inspiring teachers: Nick Connolly. He was my Year 11 literature teacher: a wild-bearded Irish poet in a Catholic boys’ school. He stirred up trouble more than once, like the time he showed us the heretical comedy <i>Life of Brian</i>. They feared he was corrupting our pure little hearts, when in reality we had not only seen it already, but had memorized half the lines.</p>
<p>Nick—of course we used his first name—made an impression from the start of the year, when he said, “If you don’t like the mark I give you, come and see me and I’ll give you whatever you want.” It took the pressure off, and told us that he was on our side: marks are not for judging, they’re for helping. A couple of times, students did take him up on that, but only when they genuinely felt they deserved a better mark. And they got it.</p>
<p>But mostly I remember his approach to reading texts. He was heartfelt and sincere in everything he did. He wanted us to encounter the texts in a meaningful way, to let them in and change us. He despised “Brodie’s Notes” and any other such crutches. He believed in the power of literature to elevate, and inspired us to believe that we too could be elevated.</p>
<p>Nick had a very particular approach to reading texts. Now remember, this is my memory of classes from a very long time ago, so think of it as my interpretation rather than what he actually said. He avoided what I would describe as the extremes of “criticism” and “appreciation”. In “criticism”, we act upon a text, setting ourselves above it, judging and dissecting, reducing it to components, and convincing ourselves of our cleverness. In “appreciation”, we set ourselves underneath a text, letting it dictate itself to us, so that our own role is purely passive, because we are unworthy to speak in the text’s presence.</p>
<p>Instead, Nick used the word “apprehension”. To apprehend a work it to hold it, to embrace it, to know it fully and all-around. Apprehension stems from empathy, a feeling of deep connection with the humanity behind the text. It is not blind to flaws, nor is it trapped in nit-picking. Apprehension implies a certain “upholding”, or perhaps even a “beholding”, a communion with a text where the humanity in the words connects with the humanity in one’s own heart.</p>
<p>Obviously, the suttas are a very different kind of text, sacred scripture rather than worldly literature. Yet when I see the Buddha speak of how we should avoid listening to Dhamma with a “fault-finding mind”; or when he emphasizes the sense of emotional joy of the Dhamma; or when he encourages good-faith inquiry into himself and his teaching; or when he presents a whole-of-life approach to making a Dhamma understanding meaningful, I cannot help but be reminded of what I learned from Nick Connolly all those years ago.</p>
<p>The Itivuttaka tells us that the sharing of the Teaching is so valuable, it is worth even more than the sharing of material things. Those who share the Teaching are indeed very helpful. Sometimes a teacher might not even know how deep their words might go, or how profoundly they influence those who listen.</p>
