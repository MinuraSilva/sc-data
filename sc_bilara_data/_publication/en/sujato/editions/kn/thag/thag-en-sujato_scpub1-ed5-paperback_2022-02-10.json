It seems it originally served to collect certain short collections, mostly verse, that were not conveniently assigned to one of the main nikāyas. Over time, however, it grew to become the largest of the nikāyas in the Pali canon. The SuttaCentral translation series only includes the six books widely regarded as the earliest, namely, Dhammapada, Sutta Nipāta, Udāna, Itivuttaka, and the collected verses of the Monks and Nuns.",

It is a pair with the Therīgāthā, the “Verses of the Senior Nuns”. These verses celebrate the joy of freedom and the life of meditation in the forest. Together these collections preserve the unique voices of hundreds of early practitioners.",
