<h1>10. The Foundations of Mindfulness</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref nya' id='nya1' href='#nya1'>NYA 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I heard</span>:</p>
<p>On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Kuru country.</p>
<p>There is town of theirs called Kammāssadamma, and there he addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus.”</p>
<p>“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><a class='ref nya' id='nya2' href='#nya2'>NYA 2</a>“Bhikkhus, this path, namely the four foundations of mindfulness, is a path that goes in one way only: to the purification of beings, to the surmounting of sorrow and lamentation, to the disappearance of pain and grief, to the attainment of the true way, to the realization of Nibbana.</p>
<p><a class='ref nya' id='nya3' href='#nya3'>NYA 3</a>“What are the four? Here a bhikkhu abides contemplating a body as a body<sup>1</sup> fully aware and mindful, having put away covetousness and grief for the world. He abides contemplating feelings as feelings, ardent, fully aware and mindful, having put away covetousness and grief for the world. He abides contemplating mind as mind, ardent, fully aware and mindful, having put away covetousness and grief for the world. He abides contemplating dhammas as dhammas, ardent, fully aware and mindful, having put away covetousness and grief for the world.</p>
<h2>Contemplation Of The Body</h2>
<h3>(I. Mindfulness of Breathing)</h3>
<p><a class='ref nya' id='nya4' href='#nya4'>NYA 4</a>“And how does a bhikkhu abide contemplating the body as a body? Here a bhikkhu, gone to the forest, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, sits down; having folded his legs crosswise, set his body erect, established mindfulness <span class='add'>on the breath</span> in front of him, always mindful he breaths in, mindful he breathes out<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>“Breathing in long, he understands: ‘I breathe in long’; breathing out long, he understands: ‘I breathe out long’. Breathing in short, he understands: ‘I breathe in short’; breathing out short, he understands: ‘I breathe out short’. He trains thus: ‘I shall breathe in experiencing a whole body’; he trains thus: ‘I shall breathe out experiencing a whole body’. He trains thus: ‘I shall breathe in tranquillizing the body process’; he trains thus: ‘I shall breathe out tranquillizing the bodily process’.</p>
<p>“Just as skilled turner or his apprentice, when making a long turn understands: ‘I make a long turn’; or when making a short turn understands: ‘I make a short turn’; so too, breathing in long, he understands:</p>
<p>‘I breathe in long’… he trains thus: ‘I shall breathe out tranquillizing the bodily process’.</p>
<h3>Insight</h3>
<p><a class='ref nya' id='nya5' href='#nya5'>NYA 5</a>“In this way he abides contemplating the body as a body in himself, or he abides contemplating the body as a body externally<sup>3</sup>, or he abides contemplating the body in himself and externally.</p>
<p>“Or else he abides contemplating in the body its arising factors, or he abides contemplating in the body its vanishing factors, or he abides contemplating in the body its arising and vanishing factors<sup>4</sup>.</p>
<p>“Or else mindfulness that ‘there is a body’ is simply established in him to the extent of bare knowledge and remembrance <span class='add'>of it</span>, while he abides independent, not clinging to anything in the world.</p>
<p>“That is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body.</p>
<h3>II. The Four Postures</h3>
<p><a class='ref nya' id='nya6' href='#nya6'>NYA 6</a>“Again, a bhikkhu, when walking, understands: ‘I walk’; when standing, understands: ‘I stand’; when sitting, understands: ‘I sit’; when lying down, understands: ‘I am lying down’; or however his body is disposed he understands accordingly.</p>
<p><a class='ref nya' id='nya7' href='#nya7'>NYA 7</a>‘… contemplating… in himself… externally… in himself and externally.</p>
<p>“… contemplating… arising factors… vanishing factors… arising and vanishing factors.</p>
<p>“… mindfulness that ‘there is a body’… not clinging to anything in the world.</p>
<p>“That also is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body.</p>
<h3>III. Full Awareness</h3>
<p><a class='ref nya' id='nya8' href='#nya8'>NYA 8</a>“Again, a bhikkhu is one who acts in full awareness when moving to and fro, who acts in full awareness when looking at and away, who acts in full awareness when flexing and extending, who acts in full awareness when wearing the patched cloak, bowl and robes, who acts in full awareness when feeding, drinking, chewing and supping, who acts in full awareness when evacuating the bowels and making water, who acts in full awareness when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, talking, and keeping silent.</p>
<p><a class='ref nya' id='nya9' href='#nya9'>NYA 9</a>“… contemplating… in himself… externally… in himself and externally… contemplating… arising factors… vanishing factors… arising and vanishing factors… mindfulness that ‘there is a body’… not clinging to anything in the world.</p>
<p>“That also is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body.</p>
<h3>IV. Foulness—The Bodily Parts</h3>
<p><a class='ref nya' id='nya10' href='#nya10'>NYA 10</a>“Again, a bhikkhu reviews this same body up from the soles of the feet and down from the top of the hair as full of many kinds of filth, thus: ‘In this body there are head-hairs, body-hairs, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone-marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, midriff<sup>5</sup>, spleen, lungs, bowels, entrails<sup>6</sup>, gorge, dung, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease<sup>7</sup>, spittle, snot, oil of the joints and urine.’</p>
<p>“Just as though there were a bag with an opening at both <span class='add'>ends</span> full of many sorts of grain such as hill rice, red rice, beans, peas, millet and white rice, and a man with <span class='add'>clear</span> eyes had opened it and were reviewing it thus: ‘This is hill rice, this is red rice, these are beans, these are peas, this is millet, this is white rice’, so too, a bhikkhu reviews this same body up from the soles of the feet and down from the top of the hair as full of many kinds of filth… and urine.</p>
<p><a class='ref nya' id='nya11' href='#nya11'>NYA 11</a>“… contemplating… in himself… externally… in himself and externally… contemplatng… arising factors… vanishing factors… arising and vanishing factors… mindfulness that ‘there is a body’… not clinging to anything in the world.</p>
<h3>V. Elements</h3>
<p><a class='ref nya' id='nya12' href='#nya12'>NYA 12</a>“Again, however it is placed, however disposed, a bhikkhu reviews this same body <span class='add'>consisting of</span> elements, thus: ‘In this body there are the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element.’</p>
<p>“Just as though a skilled butcher or his apprentice had a killed cow and were seated at the four crossroads with it cut up into pieces: so too, however it is placed, however disposed, a bhikkhu reviews this same body… and the air element.</p>
<p><a class='ref nya' id='nya13' href='#nya13'>NYA 13</a>“… contemplating… in himself… externally… in himself and externally… contemplating… arising factors… arising and vanishing factors… mindfulness that ‘there is a body’… not clinging to anything in the world.</p>
<h3>VI—XIV. The Nine Charnel Grounds<sup>8</sup></h3>
<p><a class='ref nya' id='nya14' href='#nya14'>NYA 14</a>“Again, a bhikkhu judges this same body as though he were looking at bodily remains thrown on a charnel ground, one day dead, two days dead, three days dead, bloated, livid, and oozing matter, thus: ‘This body too is of such a nature, it will be like that, it is not exempt from that.’</p>

<li>“Body as a body”: this means not confusing, during meditation, body with feeling, mind, etc. The body is contemplated just as body, feelings just as feelings, etc.</li>
<li>N. The exercise described is one mental observation not in bodily development or breath control as in Hatha-yoga. This Sutta is much recited today as a basis for meditation. Its subject, the establishment of mindfulness, forms the cornerstone of the Buddha’s instruction.</li>
<li>N. According to the Commentary, “externally” means someone else’s body, etc,; (but it could also refer to pure objectivity seen in one’s own body too); this first paragraph of the refrain emphasizes concentration (samadhi). The second paragraph on arising and falling (decaying), refers to insight (Right View). (These two notes, marked N, and others in this Sutta, are by the translator and quoted from his “Life of the Buddha” (B.P.S. Kandy, Sri Lanka).</li>
<li>Factor is elsewhere untranslated: dhammas.By seeing in oneself dhammas arising and vanishing (or passing away) the first characteristic of all living beings, impermanence, is verified.</li>
<li>This means not only the midriff but all the fascia or tough membranes which bind the various bits and pieces together and keep them in place.</li>
<li>In Thai these last two are translated “large gut, small gut”.</li>
<li>“Grease” means “skin-grease”.</li>
<li>Meaning, a place where corpses were thrown and rotted away, common in ancient India where they were used also by monks who wished to stimulate saṁvega, a sense of being deeply stirred or moved by the condition of birth and death.</li>
<li>In himself, seeing his own body like these corpses; externally perceiving a corpse in a charnel ground.</li>
<li>N. “Materialistic” (āmisa) refers to such physical things as food, clothing etc.; here to the feeling connected with them.</li>
<li>One associated with making good kamma, for instance from generosity or from meditation practice.</li>
<li>He infers the feelings in others. This is only for reflection. since insight can only be practised on the arising and falling of feelings in himself.</li>
<li>N. “Contracted” by lethargy, “exalted” from the sensual state to a state of jhāna, ‘surpassed’ in jhāna or in realization.</li>
<li>Either only by inference for reflection, or by using the knowledge of others’ minds—if he possesses it.</li>
<li>N. “Hindrance” should be taken rather in the sense of, as it were, hedges that keep one in the traffic-stream of lust, hate and delusion, rather than an obstacle that blocks the way.</li>
<li>That is it could be expected that a diligent practicer would reach either Arahantship or become a Non-returner.</li>
